today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things as a dinosaur stomping on things is the best part of my day indeed
 gasp
what's that little house you wish you were back in your own time that is too bad for you
perhaps you too will get a stomping little girl
problem s
my only problem s have to do with you interrupting my stomping
 in small text crazy utahraptor
with that utahraptor out of the way i feel better a rare pleasure indeed to have your problems put behind you and the future full of promise
imagine if that utahraptor slipped in the shower
he'd certainly wish he'd stomped the soap out of the way much as i now stomp this little house as he passed on
perhaps in his last moments the irony of the situation from my perspective would become evident
yes i will freely enjoy stomping more now that he is gone
you
i must guard against such self absorption in the future
i guess there is a lesson here for us all
i feel today that my actions will be charged with symbolism
 gasp
as a male i take on the position of the everyman with the latter syllable perhaps the most important from our post feminist perspective the house clearly represents repressed femininity at once recalling the blissful days of the past while reminding us of their fundamental injustices my action in destroying the house remains a puzzling enigma
the emphasis on male oppression is continued as i stand poised to crush this woman beneath my man foot
oh that is a part of it to be sure
 but the desires of my darker nature manifest themselves as misogyny surely that must enter into your analysis
i had a friend female who dated her roommate also female
lesbians
of course there's always a danger when you go down the 'date the person you live with' road
they broke up a week later and still had to live together

i was his roommate
the realization that i've had a homosexual affair with the utahraptor that i cannot remember at all profoundly disturbs me how could i forget such a thing
i wonder what it was like maybe i was really good
or maybe he's making the whole thing up that would explain why i don't remember it
yes thank you
i feel alot better about the whole thing now
you
what manner of proof have you
 gasp
knowing that the utahraptor and i have had an illicit affair has put a new spin on our relation i hope the easy camaraderie we share will not be lost
i also hope i was the one who ended it
what about all the good times we shared how can you be so cold blooded or was that a lie too
that was indeed a difficult breakup i'd prefer to be the person ending it given the choice
eh
anyway i've had enough of that utahraptor and his ilk i don't care what he thinks we did
what i do care about is vitamin b12
vitamin b12 also called cobalamin is important to good health
it helps maintain healthy nerve and red blood cells and is also needed to make dna the genetic material in all cells vitamin b12 is bound to the protein in food
beef liver fish eggs and milk among others
vitamin b12 has a very low potential for toxicity
vegetarians who do not eat meats fish eggs milk or milk products are at high risk of developing a vitamin b12 deficiency
individuals with stomach and small intestinal disorders may not absorb enough vitamin b12 from food to maintain healthy body stores
i have thought of the snappiest comeback ever all i have to do is trick that utahraptor into telling me what he'd like to make a living doing if he had a choice then i can say
 well sure
 if you call that 'living'
he will be so shocked i expect this zinger to go down in history as the best example of its kind ever
stomping a few buildings and women should get his attention
only if you answer me a question
if you could do anything to make a living what would it be
 if you call that living
ok so that last joke didn't work so well but wait till he hears this one i'll say you know what's great
 not being a utahraptor
that's what he is that's why it is such a good joke do you get it
what you're crazy
uh no but while you're here
you know what's great
no not being a utahrapt
god damn it
i have felt the harsh sting of my own racial joke turned against me luckily i've been saving a joke for just such an occasion
all of those hours of thinking up insults for hypothetical enemies has finally paid off
so my racist joke somehow backfired on me
well i've made up my own joke to get him today all i need to do is find that utahraptor
i hope the utahraptor is around here somewhere my legs are giving tired
there you are knock knock
utah
utaught me how to be a stupid jerk
and i was a very good student
no but see i learned it from you
today is a good day i think for pointing out the failures of others
i will consider it as a public service
to begin your house is too small and your car is slightly out of scale and you your colouring is improbable
you tiny woman are too tiny and also lack personality
my comments were addressed to the young lady beneath my foot you were not their intended target
you have difficulty discerning to whom i am speaking
imagine if we had a beach ball to kick around
it would be so much fun
so i intend to find a beach ball do you know where they are kept
maybe stomping this house will refresh your memory

where
imagine if we had a beach ball to kick around
it would be so much fun
so i intend to find a beach ball do you know where they are kept
maybe stomping this house will refresh your memory

where
i wonder if i'm the only one that feels as if he isn't living up to his own potential
as a dinosaur i mean
it's time to live this day to the max
rargh i am getting the most out of destroying this tiny log cabin
it's been nice weather too
my mouth has a nice fresh taste in it this morning
skin is not too itchy
i am looking forward to a gooey feeling beneath my feet soon
that is the plan
dinosaurs have souls
forget it all these personal revelations have left me baffled disoriented values are baseless and nothing can be known or communicated
i believe this is called nihilism
when we abandon illusions life is revealed as nothing it is nothing short of absurd
there is no objective order to the world all values are baseless and reasoning is impotent
destruction is the natural response to such a metaphysical collapse
goodbye house
it is futile to do one's best in an absurd world
if we accept that all perspectives are equally non binding then intellectual or moral arrogance will determine which perspective has precedence
my apocalyptic tenor has not been dispelled
i've got a question who the hell goes to cornwall
seriously
who the hell goes to cornwall
i know
seriously
sweet
ooh i get to be the t rex
rawr i represent nature and cannot be controlled watch as i destroy this house representing humanity's folly
you said it
rawr
today is a good day i think for taking control of my life no longer will i allow myself to be pushed around by random chance or otherwise
my old push over self is extinct now i'm a self motivated dynamo
stupid log cabin in my way prepare to be returned to the ground entropy is always increasing
you shut up don't try to push me around
you too are in my way little woman
what did you say
maybe you should stop being a jerk also
maybe that
man after what happened yesterday i guess there is a certain tension between myself and the utahraptor well i'm going to make sure that tension ends
 right now
hey do you know how i could stop the utahraptor from not being friends with me
forget it stomping is who i am
i will have to find another way to win his friendship
hey
that's not what your mom said
last night
when we had sex
man i totally blew it yesterday with the utahraptor why did i make a joke about his mom
why oh why did i make a joke about his mom
hey i need some more advice how can i apologise to the utahraptor for saying that i had sex with his mom last night
yeah i kinda shouted it after him
three times
now's my chance
uh well what i want to say is that i'm sorry i said i had sex with your mom last night i actually didn't have sex with anyone last night
or ever for that matter
i can't help it if i can't remember it
oh give me a break
after all the crazy adventures in sexy exciting locales we've had over the past two weeks it seems that the utahraptor and i are friends again
it's been a memorable two weeks indeed
do you recall a few days ago when we had that hilarious conversation
it was good times
so many memories of the past two weeks
how are you
oh
 genius
awesome i get to be marty
 this is heavy
first things's first we have to travel back in time to 1955
that was easy
ok i've got to make sure my parents meet otherwise i'll be erased from existence
oh no am i to be trapped in the 50s forever
my only hope is to get them to kiss at the enchantment under the sea dance
i will assuming lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10 04 p m
i made it back to good old 1985 but now doc is back back from the future and he's talking about my kids
something's got to be done about my kids
today is a good day i think for people volunteering unwanted personal information about themselves
should be awkward
oh
i see
 hmm that was kind of awkward
wow
that was awkward
i have received complaints apparently i can be difficult to follow and sometimes people get confused
i hope that will not be the case today with
i will go for a walk and talk about the weather
nice weather today isn't it
yes
what
i get it
everytime i tried to tell you
the words
just came out wrong
so i have to say i love you
in a song
what
i dreamed last night that i was sleeping in av ery tiny car
when i woke up my arms were sore
true story
but of course i don't try to read too much into that
it was probably just some random neurons firing in my brain
do tell
good lord
how is it that i have the same dream
every night
i see all of my relations in economic terms you provide value to me by providing me a sounding board for my ideas and also potentially as a mate
conversely this house provides no value to me and my relation with it is understandably strained
you too provide no value to me young woman that is why i stomp you with impunity
shit
i can't believe that i didn't see that obvious flaw in my new philosophy
i've got to start thinking these things through
wait that's it
from now on i will be pensive considerate i will be a reflective and thoughtful t rex
oh
yes i am a new more thoughtful dinosaur
he's right
is this the portrait
 of a dinosaur in crisis
if there were a soundtrack to my life what would it sound like i wonder
imagine if it had vocals and a drum solo
it'd be awesome
here there would be some ominous music for will the girl survive
well it um it's not like they wouldn't get paid
 sob
i have determined something exciting brace yourselves for what i have discovered is nothing less than
the secret to being loved
it's so easy

huh
oh no
so anyway the secret i discovered to being loved is simply
hey what's up
i was just talking about the secret to being loved
ok some other time
oh boy
i bet i can figure out hundreds of hilarious differences
for instance as a male i can be impatient sometimes to my own detriment notice how i destroy this house rather than walking around it
it is as if we are from two different planets
yes the two sexes certainly do have some hilarious differences
hey
i can also pee standing up
i wonder are there any universes parallel to our own
a mirror universe if you will
but perhaps in this universe different decisions were made choice piles upon choice until the world is a strangely different place
it raises many philosophical questions
for instance is there any true self
what a brave new world it would be
seriously
noo don't do it
say goodbye to your house dromiceiomimus if you don't like it you can lodge a complaint with my foot
ha ha ha
i love being bad i mean i love being good because bad is good to us and by us i mean the entire universe
the utahraptor
sweet
well i hope wherever the utahraptor ended up he's alright maybe he landed in a universe just like ours but where one simple thing has undergone a sinister and illustrative change
or maybe he's travelled to the universe of the lesbains
but i guess no matter where he is this is the end of our daily conversations i don't know what i'm going to do with the second half of my day if he's not around
 sigh
utahraptor it's you you're back from the alternate universe but something's different
prove it
 gasp
i'm not as gullible as everybody seems to think i am i know that the utahraptor is not the one from my universe
i've got to rescue the real utahraptor
but how i don't really know how to do anything besides stomp on things maybe if he needed something stomped i could help
i could also contribute to a discussion re philosophy
i'm torn
i see you've rebuilt your house too bad i'm the personification of its destruction in a manor of speaking
ha ha ha two in a row
yes house themed puns come courtesy of me the evil t rex
youuuutahraptor
oh youuutahraptor
i was just wondering if it bothers you when i senselessly step on people
oh that's too bad
cause here i go
rebuilt again eh i'll have to make a note of that in my logs
ha ha ha
wait does that even make sense
ah who cares the utahraptor's been having a bad time here and i'm to credit i wonder how long he'll stay
 i can't wait till he finds out i replaced his toothpaste with a competing brand of toothpaste
no wait
stay
brush your teeth
and you say nobody had goatees
huh well tell you what i'll stomp on her first then you go ok
the presence of the evil utahraptor in this universe has raised the very philosophical questions i had earlier been concerned about
for instance
can the two utahraptors be considered the same person is the evil one just the result of some decision made differently
are the actions of one the restrained impulses of the other or are they really two different individuals
could one in time become the other
additionally
utahraptor it's you
hey
i lived in your house while you were gone
i ate some food
oh oh
sounds like another emotional roller coaster
and here we go
i have much to offer a potential mate i am big and strong and oh so sexy
if only i could find someone preferably in my own neighbourhood to be my companion and also to have sex with
why hello
i notice you are attractive
care to put our emotional stability on the line in exchange for a chance at happiness
so
 sob
alone again
pay attention now
the circuit satisfiability problem is determining if there are some inputs that make the outputs of a circuit true
a closely related problem is the formula satisfiability problem sap which can be mapped one to one and in linear time to the circuit satisfiability problem
if we can solve sat problems in f n time then circuit sat can be solved in 0 n + f n time
indeed therefore sat is as hard as circuit sat
similarly hard problems are clique vertex cover and the travelling salesman problem
solving these problems p can be accomplished in polynomial time
verifying solutions np can also be done in polynomial time
the question is does p = np
today is my favourite day of all
april fool's day
chief among my loves is the love of tricking people i bet i can totally fool the utahraptor today
i feel certain the opportunity will present itself
here he comes
hey don't try to trick me
sorry i'm busy
april fool's
another day full of possibilities
i wonder what adventures i'll have today
i wonder
hello everyone it's me
ho ho good to see you too d
that's ok
you you really mean it
if only
 sigh
if only
last thursday was a big day
let's recap
i have much to offer a potential mate i am big and strong and oh so sexy
if only i could find someone preferably in my own neighbourhood to be my companion and also to have sex with
why hello
i notice you are attractive
care to put our emotional stability on the line in exchange for a chance at happiness
so
ahh
good times
i had a friend once who joined a sorority
we were all like
 at least i don't have to buy my friends
it didn't really make sense because we were already her friends for free but we ran with it
she ended up married i think
oh my gosh what
oh my gosh
the utahraptor's brother is having children it seems the time of parenthood is upon us
how quickly we find ourselves in the positions of adults
dromiceiomimus do you think you might have children some day
that's exactly how i feel you've articulated it perfectly
will i ever feel qualified
what do you mean cute
 cute
i can't believe the utahraptor thinks that t rexes are cute i am not cute my daily romps inspire fear in all who meet me
fear
dromiceiomimus do you think me and my little green arms are cute or do they rather inspire a chilling fear in your very soul
but look i'm crushing a house it is very frightening
what could be more terrifying than being crushed by a t rex
what
does no one realize that this is a very sensitive issue for me
i have been thinking and i have come up with the perfect solution to the problem of my being considered by others to be cute
i will get a pet
a little animal that will follow me around on my adventures be my companion someone to keep my bed warm at night
also this pet will have to be cuter than i am thereby making me look even tougher in comparison
a small pet perhaps something bite sized
yes have you any suggestions
thanks anyway
guess what i got last night
a dog
did you know that dogs and dinosaurs co existed
good
i am excited to go play with my new pet dog
i am thinking t junior
what about dogasaurus rex
well it's better than utahraptor
what is that anyway a place
 utah
i've got to remember to feed my pet dog
i forgot to feed the dog i'll do it tomorrow
got any plans for the summer
shoot you know what i was supposed to feed the dog today
oh hell
god damn it can you believe i forgot again

shit
i have a friend of my own age who is having a relationship the only word for it is affair with a woman who is engaged to be married
it's time for
it kind of came out of nowhere she is into him and he is into her so where's the problem what's the big deal about polygamy
the problem of course is the fianc who as i understand it does not support his wife to be sleeping around with another man
further complications both men look the same it's a little weird
how am i to advise this friend should he break it off should he let the woman make her own decisions
yes it's a hackneyed situation but one which all involved are living as we speak
hey wait
come back
you forgot to give me the answer to my problem
today
 sigh
today i am troubled
troubled by thoughts of my own mortality
what if i don't live forever then there would be no more t rex no more me
i would be gone
have i done anything worthwhile with my life
that is our ultimate destiny
well my dog ran away i know
can you believe it
i guess some people just aren't cut out for having pets
i said i guess some people just aren't cut out for having pets
i say i am not
my dog ran away by his own free will
i wonder what's bothering the utahraptor he totally wigged out on me yesterday
what a great expression
did you hear the utahraptor totally wigged out on me yesterday
he totally did
yesterday
yesterday he wigged out
how long have you been standing there
don't make me choose
i have been compiling a list that i think might be of value
what i have compiled is nothing less than
a list of phrases you should never say because nothing good will ever come of them
first on the list what do you mean you don't love me
see what i mean
oh
yikes
geez man
thanks for the tip
today is a good day i think for going to all you can eat restaurants
imagine
all i can eat
as a t rex i appreciate being able to gorge myself for one low price
indeed
 gasp
i have not
i'm going to eat so many wings
oh oh
cover your eyes
alright i'm a plumber come to fix your pipes but you have no money also you're asian
perhaps through sexual intercourse
whew
that was graphic
wait why do you need sugar
oh my goodness
is this the face of exploitation
here's a question to ask myself
 why am i here
the answer
i have no clue
sorry
my point is
yes i just swore i said
fine
that utahraptor and his ilk i don't care what he thinks we did
what i do care about is vitamin b12
 if only i knew more about it
 and that's when i woke up and realized that the past few weeks had all been some crazy dream it was all a dream
what
but you're a guy aren't you
he she's right
it's all so meaningless
no wonder nobody likes me
why should i even bother stomping this house it's just going to get rebuilt
screw it
screw everything
oh i'm just practicing how was i
i know eh
i wish i was never born
and that makes me the love interest
i'm a ruffian with a heart of gold are there any sensual socialites on board
you are repressing her free spirit and sexuality notice how i am a throughly modern hero despite my being born in the 1900s i am appealing to a hypothetical audience 100 years in the future
sweet
would you say that not even god himself could tea us apart
i was a fool
i have discovered a new philosophy for life that appeals to my own sense of self worth
egoism
in egoism all your actions are motivated by a desire to make things easy for one person yourself for instance i crush this house because it's in my way my actions are justified thanks to egoism
they probably realized what a great dinosaur i'd be and figured it would be in their own interests to creat me
 in conclusion it's untenable you must be a lot of fun at parties
oh boy i wonder what the utahraptor and i are going to talk about today
you know what
 i really look forward to seeing him
ah
ahh
choo
i have decided to become a scientist dinosaur all i need to complete the ensemble is glasses and a lab coat
you can call me
professor tyrannosaurus rex phd
do you have any science questions you'd like answered
it depends on what alleles you're talking about in the same gene they're called an allelic series but in different genes a set of alleles is known as a haplotype
and now i will demonstrate stomping physics
i i don't know
i have surprised even myself
so then today is a good day for learning to play the piano
for such a skilled dinosaur as myself it should be simple
besides nothing says cultured like playing the piano
no i feel i can do both
what
why not
but
i bet if i could play the piano i would finally be happy with myself
i have been working on a script a noir about a computer programmer who gets involved in a snuff film conspiracy the title
 a bort
 r etry
 m urder
so the main character the programmer saves the girl from the killer but then makes an error a fatal error
well
so far yeah
but there is a scene where he types and the screen projects onto his face
you must not have heard what my main character's name is
stack overflow
today is a good day i think for picking up a foreign language to better myself and the world so to speak
now which language to choose
i know i'll just learn all of them
nenu maamsamu chepalu thinanu
nena shudda shaakaahaarini
pokazi mi kade boli
tova e dobre
saluton
mi parolas esperanton
mi scias
oni rabatencis min
 asian characters
it has come to my attention that i have different interests than i did when i was a child in many significant ways we are two different people
so the questions is
who am i
since an individual can evolve over time what makes them a person at all is there no connection between myself as a child and myself now besides the fact that we share a now post pubescent body
what is the point about worrying about the self if the self is in a constant state of change
why should we bother assigning an identity to what is essentially one frame of a constantly changing motion picture
you raise some good points however you forget one crucial thing
nobody asked you
man that was indeed a good zinger i got the utahraptor with yesterday i wonder if i can get him again today with some such similar ploy
just to keep the friendship interesting you understand
hey i bet if i ignore him it will arouse a reaction
time to start practicing say something to me
what's that i'm sorry i wasn't paying attention
this is awesome
what's that i'm sorry i wasn't paying attention
huh oh you're still here what were you saying
yes
ahhh such a fine day an excellent day to stomp things i should think
there i see just such a thing for me to stomp but then are all things not equal under mine the mightiest of feet
nothing beats a relaxing day of stomping humans and their tiny accessories especially for a t rex such as myself
hah i'd like to see that
and yet here were are
see i've stomped hundreds of humans and nothing ever happens but a satisfying squish
what have i done
what's happening to me i feel so different all of a sudden
my brain is flooding with new ideas and concepts
this cabin for example represents the great works of mankind my foot symbolizing a derridesque deconstruction forever driving a wedge between the artist and his creation
but what is a universe compared to the collective arts of countless civilizations
here comes that utahraptor again no doubt to debunk my pseudo philosophical ideals
what
have i learned nothing
ahhh my old dinosaur bones yearn for a simpler time
truly ignorance is bliss ignorance and stomping humans that is
if that stupid utahraptor hadn't told me his theory i could easily stomp a tiny cabin like this wihout a care in the world
indeed we would indeed we would
i knew this would get your attention now why did you tell me your theory in the first place
funny i don't remember that
but what if i could
well then i'd best begin my preparations for time travel i'll stop that utahraptor of 3 days ago from telling the past me about his theory
swirling maelstrom of dark energies check
dino goggles check well that's everything i guess i'm ready to go back through time
ahh three days in the past now i'll get utahraptor to tell his theory to me instead of the past me
say you wouldn't happen to have any new theories to tell me perhaps about humans and dinos not existing in the same time period
not again
i can't believe it i'm the source of my own problems but i so enjoy blaming society for my shortcomings
perhaps a good stomping will ease my troubled mind
pretty much yeah
i guess you're here to gloat utahjerktor
whaa
seriously i guess my trip through time wasn't all bad then i probably shouldn't have slept with my grandmother though
shut up
i have been thinking lately
does anyone truly own the internet
i shall become its first and only lord
god
yes
erk
something is amiss
perhaps it is simply a problem with my vision
does the world look normal to you
god
you gave me shitty eyeballs
fucker
when i'm dead i want to be rembered not for my fossiled remains but for my
rock music
whhhoooooooo
god
but god
rock music
are there lots of hot babes in hell
that was a joke hot babes hell hot hell is hot
i the t rex have come to a momentus descision
i wanna get laid
whooooo where can i score me some female t rex dinosaurs
god
seriously
i've got lots of those
 sigh i think it would be a great day to do some stomping
bwwhaahaahaaa take that little tiny house and that little tiny car
bad books i never thought about it
hahaha you're going down little woman
wha
i'm in everybody's bad book
but i want to be in the good books
it could happen think about it
have you ever wondered why dinosaurs are so loud
i mean is there any reason to be shouting have we lost a puppy are we dissatisfied with the taste of tar do we hurt our feet by crushing puny log cabins
maybe it's because my wife left
huh
what a country
today i think i will win over the utahraptor with my wit
i have been carefully constructing a pun that not only applies to him as an individual but can also be appreciated by countless others
sounds like you'll be making a lot of green
get it get it green
what the hell is it going to take
lately i have been questioning my choice to remain single
automobiles responsibility children housing
she looks like a comely mate i will impress here by my finesse and skill
huh
shit
today i will become
a comic artist
i will win the nobel prize for webcomics
i will have a garage for six cars
i will have a telephone that lets me talk to corey feldman
hello friend
would you like to have an adventure
i hear once yonder a tale is told the cattle are rough and the women are bold
i err you see
the story is
there is a humorous
do not fear friend it w
merely a failed politic
please have a candy friend
we're gonna party like it's 1985
hello it's nice to meet you my name is julia gulia
now that is some grade a top choice meat
do you really want to hurt me do you really want to make me cry
do you really want to hurt me do you really want to make me cry
you could have brought that to my attention yesterday
enough of this life of a bachelor the moment has arrived
i am finally ready to settle down and start a family
all i need now is a female t rex with similar interests
oh and a nice body
with a nice long tail
 that's hot
i will seduce her with a two pronged attack of my stomping skills and wit
yes i have a fine wit
yes indeed for i can do impressions
this is you
guess who got a role in the new play down at the community centre
me
i play tony a widower who has managed alone to raise his young daughter right he's a rugged mechanic with a heart of gold just waiting for the right person to come along
 someone to melt his icy exterior and reveal the big furry tony teddy bear within
tony's a character i'm playing in a show
not likely
oh oh
sounds like i'm in for some hilarious misunderstandings
hi dromiceiomimus sun's sure hot today eh
no no the sun
ha ha what a hilarious misunderstanding
jesus
hi
sure
wait did you mean this weekend or the weekend after this
looks like another hilarious misunderstanding
i really don't like doing the dishes
that is why i will ask the utahraptor to do them for me
oh man it's going to be so sweet when he says yes
i'll be able to cook all sorts of fancy foods now that i'm freed of that soul crushing chore of doing the damned dishes
yes i have a question to ask you
but
you're sure
argh
i really hate doing the dishes
aw
i hope you like disappointing sequels
uh ok i'm a t rex but uh all my symbolism is stripped down in exchange for my mindless destruction
wasn't this one on a boat
too bad nobody saw it
i don't know
at the end i get to attack a city
it's plausible
i am strutting today because i am assured of getting what i want
my horoscope has promised me this
and it was right here i am crushing a house just like i intended to have i become and unstoppable force of will
yes but today i have predestination on my side
i think you will find that i am full of surprises
for instance remember when you couldn't figure out who snuck into your house just to eat some cookies that was me surprise
i feel that i know what's best for me and i have no right to judge your beliefs
all beliefs and ethics are relative
i stomp this house because i feel it would be a good idea to do so do not judge me dromiceiomimus
that is the beauty of relativism we both are
ethical relativism is the best philosophy ever
but your first assumption is flawed i doubt you can find even one universal constant even your revealing example of baby rape is practiced by some granted these people are considered monsters but isn't that just a case of the majority condemning a minority i don't mean to justify baby rape but only to point out that it's unlikely you can come up with even one belief that is universal
it occurs to me
i am indeed god at stomping on things
in fact i would venture that i am the best at such endeavours
there are probably others whom you may never meet but who have even greater skill than you
you you're right i can never be assured of my own superiority even in this modest arena
for me this has been a lesson in humility
today is a good day i think for public displays of affection
everyone else seems to think so at least
hey dromiceiomimus care to witness a public display of affection i seem to see them all the time whenever i go out walking
wouldn't be the first time
no
that was a joke besides how would i even do that i'd just sit there kissing my own arm
sorry to disappoint anyway i'm going to go finish my walk
eww gross
quit making out you two
that girl with the brown hair sure is a dish
hey buddy do yo know who that girl with the brown hair is i'd really like to ask her out on a date she is a very good looking young lady
darn it why does matt have all the luck
i'm jealous of him because he gets to spend time with a girl that i like
you're right i had lost my way
thanks friend
i propose a journey to the moon
i have constructed a rocket ship for myself and a guest of my choosing the wood from this house will provide the fuel
i will give your offer my consideration
lunar women are good for stomping
i concede it easily
now where is my wallet
oh shit
it is on the moon
i propose a journey to the moon
i have constructed a rocket ship for myself and a guest of my choosing the wood from this house will provide the fuel
i will give your offer my consideration
lunar women are good for stomping
i concede it easily
now where is my wallet
oh shit
it is on the moon
here is a list of adjectives i would like to have chosen when describing me
1 sated
second on the list alluring followed closely by stompin'
fourth callipygian pronounced kal lip pee je en adj having beautifully proportioned buttocks
i e me
5 magnanimous which is
which
i know what that means
i have felt reflective of late
today is a good day i think for asking profound philosophical questions
beginning with the most modest why am i here
what is the purpose of my life
is it true that the only questions worth asking are those that cannot be answered
is there any greater meaning to anything
there is what is it
w what
i don't care
another beautiful hot day i look forward to these dog days of summer
i suppose you could say i have a sunny disposition
or predisposition anyways the point is that this hot weather makes me feel great
why thank you
lovely
hey um listen if i were a girl dinosaur and if you weren't into dudes and if i said think nothing of it lovely to you what would you think
nope
oh my goodness
that means the dromiceiomimus
oh my goodness
could it be could it be true that the dromiceiomimus has a crush on me
one way to find out
oh hey d i was just stomping around here you know stomping the old houses
um
what are you up to
ha ha nothing of course
so excuse me please
holy cow what a disaster
um look you can't tell anyone but i think the dromiceiomimus has a crush on me
she did but you don't understand
she called me lovely yesterday
this situation with the dromiceiomimus has raised some interesting romantic questions
for instance
what is love
is it nothing more than a convenience a mere
 oh
oh hello there um ha ha you know what i don't remember well be seeing you
dear lord
this has got to stop
yes i can't even vocalize my own self obsessed musings because i'm suddenly afraid of what the dromiceiomimus might think
don't judge me
enough of these high school does she like me shenanigans
time to take matters into my own hands
hi dromiceiomimus you're probably wondering why i'm stomping on this house the reason is that i think we need to have a talk and this was an excuse for us to spend some time together
what do you mean
oh yeah it was nice we had chai tea
and then we had dinosaur sex
what i'll remember best about my night with the dromiceiomimus could only be one thing
the many games of scrabble
and if it isnt ms syzygy herself
never
those were indeed good games of scrabble
yeah the dromiceiomimus and i played two nights ago
during
i wonder if there would ever be a nation in the future that described itself in opposition to other nations
and in this future nation there would be trees and lakes and birds and beavers
beavers would be important somehow
also this future land everybody would live in igloos and fight bears
yeah because my future country is in the great while north and therefore everybody lives in igloos
so it's my made up country
it doesn't actually exsist you know it is made up chimerical
i have been quietly seeking out part time employment and my search has finally come to an end
tomorrow i start in my new employ
i will be a bouncer
and if people start causing trouble i will say are you looking for trouble mister because you have found the trouble you were looking for
then i will stomp on him like this
or perhaps like this
i cannot for now i work as a bouncer and stomping on unruly customers is part of my job
noooo
i babysat a pterodactyl last night it was pretty fun i red him his favourite stories we played some games but then i lost him so i ate some sandwiches and went home
all in all a good night
but she can have more right she won't mind if one goes missing right
oh no oh no oh no i lost the baby i was sitting i am the world's worst babysitter
i'm screwed
today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things as a dinosaur stomping is the best part of my day indeed
i think the dromiceiomimus has a crush on me
sure
sure did
yes can we continue this later i have to go babysit a little pterodactyl
i lost the baby i was babysitting
i'm screwed
well if there has been a moral to my life over the past few days it has been this never lose a baby
never do that
never lose a baby because if you do the mother will be very angry until the baby is returned
never lose a baby because if you do people likely won't trust you with babies in the future
that's true
never lose a baby
lost babies turn up in the strangest places for instance
under the couch
that's where he was
under the couch of all the places for a lost baby to be
yes i bought it on layaway
sure
i have compiled a list of people i enjoy seeing a list if you will
 of my friends
dromiceiomimus you are on my list of friends
think nothing of it
tiny woman you are not on my list prepare for a stomping
well utahraptor i'm glad you asked i've compiled a list of my friends and i am stomping on those who are not on my list
why yes as a matter of fact i
hey you're off the list
ooh
oooooh
 hey dromiceiomimus which is better love or sex
i see
before you tell me which is better love or sex
that wasn't an option
hey
come back here
today is a good day i think for preparing a special meal
i'd better go gather the ingredients
i can't find any of the ingredients i need what the hell it's not like i'm looking for some ancient spice i just want some paprika
argh so frustrated
oh i just can't find the ingredients i need for the special meal i'm preparing it's very frustrating
screw it we're having kraft dinner and she can deal
after the success of my role of tony the hard living mechanic i have won another role
this play is more abstract for you see
i play religion
i am faith trust and hope i am the profound belief in a power larger and more important than ourselves
i am truth and beauty
i am love and humility
it's the role i was born to play
what's that
nooooo
our friendship is doomed
 so the utahraptor's playing science to my religion eh
 this means war
 science will wither in the face of my sense of community and sharing
 how can science hope to compete with my gifts of enlightenment and hope i bring nothing less than inner peace
 what
 oh my god
 science has all the answers again
 so the utahraptor's playing science to my religion eh
 this means war
 science will wither in the face of my sense of community and sharing
 how can science hope to compete with my gifts of enlightenment and hope i bring nothing less than inner peace
 what
 oh my god
 science has all the answers again
stupid science thinking it has all the answers to all the questions
wait that's it
i can win this by asking the big questions the important unanswerable questions that science doesn't have an answer to
 why are we here what is our purpose that sort of thing
shut up
you know you can't answer any important questions you can say something to how but nothing to why
yes that's exactly why we have religion
that's easy
stupid science
he thinks he's such hot stuff
just because there are different religions with different opinions on things he dismisses them all
couldn't they all be describing the same shared desire for an understanding of what's bigger than ourselves
you know what science's problem is
we sure have some good times eh
comics are words or images juxtaposed in deliberate sequence
let's see hours of unpaid labour heavy lifting getting to see all your laundry
no thanks chuckles
today is a good day i think to become a famous author
to that end i will write a novel
it will be about a young man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect like creature
i will call my book the metamorphazoid
the story ends when the young man whom i shall call gregory dies scorned by his family and loved ones
do you mean to imply that i've plagiarized it good sir
why what cheek
today is a good day i think for sharing secrets
hey dromiceiomimus want to know a secret
ok my secret is that i stole the utahraptor's couch last night don't tell him alright
oh
well ah heh
you see the thing is
um
can i let you in on a secret
i wonder if there is an essential feminine one that transcends histories and cultures
similarly could i myself be the essential masculine
why i believe i could what am i besides the real true essence of male ness the invariable and fixed properties which define masculine for now and forever
i sure am great
truly i am the epitome of the male form
 pipes means muscles right
that's slang right
slang of today's youth culture
today i'm going to play by my own rules
and luckily for me these rules clearly stipulate that i can stomp on whatever i want
playing by my own rules is fun
why i think i'll play by my own rules from now on
nihilism
oh yeah
and i was all my apocalyptic tenor has not been dispelled
i'm really looking forward to the little soiree i've got lined up for tonight
party at my house
hey are you still in for tonight
oh that's too bad well some other time
great
the only downside is that the dromiceiomimus won't be able to come
shit she was
why do all my parties always turn into one big oktoberfest
beer and sausages
i am tired of things not getting done my way
therefore i am going into politics
as a politician i will have power and influence things will get done and they will get done my way finally i will be the person making all the important decisions
i see
will you vote for me
your mom's a librarian
that's awesome
today is a good day i think to find god
are you in this house god i am looking for you come out come out whereever you are ready or not here i come
how do you mean
oh i see what you're saying i guess that makes sense
i can't believe you were hiding behind the couch the entire time
who can forget the events of july 30 2215
their significance cannot be overstated
believe in yourself and you can do anything
i also enjoy
 wow that's very good for a first try
and
 just do what you think is best
i also like i do love you as a friend
what
ok then
 ninety eight ninety nine one hundred
ready or not here i come
where are you utahraptor are you hiding under this house come out come out wherever you are
no
where could you have gone
are you hiding beneath this woman no
no i'm looking for you
it's a mystery
why am i here
good question
am i here to fulfill some higher purpose how can that be if i remain completely unaware of it
it appears that there is some aspect of myself that craves a meaning any meaning to my actions
good idea
so what meaning do you see my action representing
aw man
now i feel worse than ever
today is a good day i think for lavishing praise on people
is this perhaps the ultimate secret to popularity
hello little dromiceiomimus you are certainly a nice colour this morning
think nothing of it my good lady
you will stomp nicely young woman good show
i am and you utahraptor are quite affable at times
there's no time for that now
we've got a president to save
i'm worried that i'm putting on weight
i'm worried that i'll grow to be a fat dinosaur
it's not that i'm suddenly eating more i think it's that my metabolism is slowing down so the food i eat is going straight to my trendy hips
that's why i'm vowing to get out and get exercise every day from now on
it's good exercise
but then they'd be less of a deal
i'd be wasting my money
i fear that i've lost something something important
something i'll never get back again
something that was very special something that i guess part of me thought i'd always have with me something that i'd tried to hold on to but lost nonetheless
something
what i was talking about a baby tooth
alright i was talking about my virginity
what is the point of going to sleep i'm just going to wake up again
wait i'm a genius
with my nights freed up from the chore of sleep i will become unstoppable i'll have an extra eight hours to plan and scheme
i will stop sleeping right away tonight
who knows what the future holds for me
what the hell man
it's been like twenty years
where do babies come from
an excellent course of inquiry
solving this mystery will put to rest many of the niggling mysteries of my creation i will finally have an origin story
i do
please fill me in
mom did that
i was thinking about my grade school days last night and i realized i couldn't remember most of the people who were in my classes
i've forgotten pretty much everyone who didn't go on to the same school as i did
this has raised some pretty profound questions for me first off it seems evident that i have finite space in my brain and things are getting erased
the problem is i don't have any control conscious at least over what gets deleted and what stays
right i'd say a good part of who a person is comes from their experiences but if they are forgotten where does that leave the person
there's only one way to find out it seems that once again i will have to contract
amnesia
i can't remember a thing about myself
therefore i will use deduction to determine my role and place in society
judging by this well conditioned body including thighs and coupled with what i feel intuitively to be an impressive intellect i can be one thing and one thing alone
an astronaut
i'm not
seriously
kick ass
that's good too
i think i'll go for a walk today
uncanny it's as if i'm seeing the world for the first time
this amnesia has given me the wide eyed innocence of a new born child
i'm filled with wonder and awe at the most casual display of nature's beauty
look at that house incredible
everything is precious the glory of the world astounds me
i don't know it just feels right
arguably yes
many jokes begin with this line it is called the set up and is analogous to establishing shots in films or first paragraphs in essays
it alerts the audience that what follows is likely to be a short story with a humorous climax
what is the attraction to this structure of humor why are there so many jokes about men walking into bars
part of the attraction to this structure may be its possibilities most anything can happen in a bar especially if this bar is contained within the wild and wooly world of the verbal jest
good question
the joke assumes some sophistication on the part of the audience an expectation gleamed from previous jokes that the bar is a drinking establishment
the ouch is startling how could entering a bar hurt it forces us to now re evaluate our most basic assumptions
we must ask ourselves what if the bar were a bar proper and by walking into it the man actually physically walked into it
it is this confusion on the part of the listener that is responsible for the humor
i feel odd as if my amnesia is wearing off
uncanny all my memories are flooding back in a torrent of life and history
i remember this tiny house and car i liked to stomp on them regularly like so
and i remember you dromiceiomimus
do i ever
and i remember this tiny woman i remember i liked to stomp on her
holy how'd you do that thing with your voice just now
seriously it makes me feel like doing whatever you say
today is a good day i think for going for oh shoot
i forgot about my dentist's appointment
damn damn damn i can't call now and reschedule because i'll have to admit that i forgot entirely
then i'll probably have to explain that i had amnesia and the dentist will think i'm crazy
i do indeed
but dr cohen
he always seemed so enthusiastic
i have compiled a list of different ways to say no
one way is to shake or nod your head depending on which culture you're in
another good way is to suck in air through your teeth this indicates a severe problem with whatever is being proposed
violence can also be an effective way of saying no
for instance i find stomping to be unambiguous
you know it
i have taken the aesthetics and beliefs of the romanticism movement and adopted them for my own
i now emphasize my own subjective experience as visionary and transcendental
i no longer value piety or virtue or constancy or consistency or even the search for scientific truth i only value my own capacity for experience
as a consequence my own actions can no longer be judged by any public idea of right or wrong as experience is amoral even my own conscience cannot judge my actions and i am free from reproach and judgment
well um
i thought maybe we'd have a good time discussing it
 there's a boxing kangaroo at the circus
there's a boxing kangaroo at the circus
it's so great dromiceiomimus it's a real boxing kangaroo with big red boxing gloves like the zeitgeist and in cartoons and he boxes a person so hard that they get their hat knocked off and when they go to pick up the hat he boxes them in the butt we have to go
you sure did dromiceiomimus and i are going you should come because the kangaroo is going to solve all his problems with his fists and when he's done his problems are gonna be solved right in the face
hah hah what's the matter monocle guy you don't like being boxed by a kangaroo
hah monocle guy the kangaroo just punched off your monocle
 there's a boxing kangaroo at the circus
there's a boxing kangaroo at the circus
it's so great dromiceiomimus it's a real boxing kangaroo with big red boxing gloves like the zeitgeist and in cartoons and he boxes a person so hard that they get their hat knocked off and when they go to pick up the hat he boxes them in the butt we have to go
you sure did dromiceiomimus and i are going you should come because the kangaroo is going to solve all his problems with his fists and when he's done his problems are gonna be solved right in the face
hah hah what's the matter monocle guy you don't like being boxed by a kangaroo
hah monocle guy the kangaroo just punched off your monocle
dear when you smile at me
i heard a melody
it haunted me from the start
something inside of me
that was awesome
i have a friend
let's call him ryan
anyway ryan moved to a new city this weekend he loaded up all his books into his car but when he arrived they were soaked
ruined
pulp
i understand he was pretty upset about this
well that's not very supportive
hey that's right
oh boy
today is a good day i think for adventure
what i never got to go on my adventure
this makes me so angry
why are you angry
i don't have a tv
well my screenplay for a bort r etry m urder didn't work out nobody wanted to produce it so i have started a new screenplay based on the structured query language for databases
 it's called
 update bodies set status = ' dead '
it's about a database administrator for a large company who uncovers a secret database by accident
a database of murders
how do you mean
pretty nerdy my friend
today is a good day i think to find some excitement
hmm stomping this house is kind of exciting but it's a more familiar feeling like getting served a favourite meal it's good but i know how it's going to end i think i can do something more exciting
 well stomping on this woman is exciting but again too familiar
i'm looking for excitement but so far it's been pretty much a bust
yeah man
and i could land on my enemies houses
 surprise
i want to be dick tracy for halloween
but my mom says i should be a witch
oooh she burns me up only pussies dress up as witches
who told you that
harry potter's not a pussy
because i have to put my foot down
i'm just trying to get a leg up
i'm stepping out
the blue man group
what i really do like it it makes me so happy
today is a good day i think for a guest comic
i'm in a comic
it appears that by informing me of my current existence within a medium of entertainment the guest comic author has already broken the so called fourth wall
but as a character in a comic i am required to be a source of entertainment this is a demand that i have up to now been unaware of thus i must provide the reader with some semblance of comedic banter perhaps a pun using the phrase breaking the fourth wall and my current action of crushing many walls
since i do not have a joke readily available i will just have to resort to entertainment through violence
how so
but what if he forgets to come up with a funny punchline if i have no free will does that mean that i will be forced to just take up space in the last caption and say nothing at all
 i don't see a punchline
seriously who does that
did you know you can find instructions for making a bomb on the interweb
i didn't have any plutonium though
so i filled it with pictures from when we were kids
there's a house to stomp
stomp stomp stomp
wait i've been here before it's the tyrone residence mr tyrone is arguing with his sons again
and there's mrs tyrone wandering aimlessly i could stomp her too
why shouldn't i stomp them all
oh
i've been thinking if my decisions are based on my desires and my desires are just the product of phsysiological and environmental factors beyond my control
then i have no control over the decisions i make
see if i am just the psychological product of my environment then each action i take i could not have taken in any other way i had no choice
like squashing this cat
 free will doesn't exist
 what
yes
and you're drunk
 maslow says i can only maximize my full potential and achieve the highest state of being in one way realization of self
i'm continuing to stomp things until someone yells look out a monster
to which i will reply look at yourselves who is the real monster my friends
 look at yo
oh wow
i have noticed that eating different foods has different physiological effects on myself there must be some 'balanced diet' that maximizes the agreeable effects of such nourishment
with this in mind i have created the nutrinomicon
the nutrinomicon divides foods into four different 'groups ' these 'groups' have prescribed allowances per day
by following the nutritional regime of the nutrinomicon you can be assured of a fine diet
what
but i stayed up all night working on the celebrated and unmentionable nutrinomicon
i even skipped dinner which is ironic because i was working on a guide to nutrition
oh boy
i believe i'll offer some advice on employing everyday filmic techniques
to begin when filming you always want to say on one side of the action this is because if you suddenly start filming from the opposite side of the action it will appear to be reversed
observe
notice how i appear to be stomping in the opposite direction
no please be my guest
you're not the boss of me
when you spend your time talking to a t rex
everyone's a winner
hello dromiceiomimus would you care to have a little chat perhaps
oh ok
well that neither proves nor disproves my theory
today i've been operating under the assumption that when you talk to a t rex such as myself you understand everyone's a winner
like everybody is better for the experience geez man it's not that complicated a sentiment
what's the deal with people who quote other people all the time
anyway i'd better get on with my day
i know i'm trying to collect on the insurance money
oh no
what the hell was he talking about i've got the insurance papers right here
 joy
who uses the word joy anymore happy sure but outside of a religious context is anything described as joyous anymore besides weddings i guess and childbirths
i have so experienced joy i have so
it was awesome
i wonder what life would be like if i were a woman
i wonder
hello dromiceiomimus do you want to go shopping for women's underwear we are after all both women
nor do i
why no besides going out with a strapping young man such as yourself
it's a date
i'm glad i keep these little fantasies to myself
what if people can't tell when i'm being sarcastic
this is a serious question what if in the past when i assume somebody has picked up on what i took to be obvious sarcasm they took me at face value oh my god the misunderstandings would be legion this is a huge concern
i may have unintentionally lied or alienated every one of my friends
utahraptor can you tell when i'm being sarcastic
ok just give me a second to think of something
 ahem
oh no i'm so worried what if people can't tell when i'm being sarcastic
i just found out that a hurricane is expected to hit this area
more specifically the area including my house
a category one we hardly ever get actual hurricanes here
i am the excited one
in fact more like category fun this is going to be awesome
why i'll be able to don a raincoat and hat go outside in the storm and pretend to give pseudo meteorological reports
 back to you utahraptor
my house
computational linguistics is the study of computer based language processing
a major area of computational linguistics is that of ambiguity resolution it turns out that many things people say in a language english for example can have more than one meaning
consider the phrase fruit flies like a banana is it describing the taste of fruit flies or rather flying fruit how can a computer hope to figure this out
many have focused on statistical modelling of language but this approach is approximate
what do you know about computational linguistics
shit man you know more about this than i do
you know what you should be the one doing the talking here
i received an invitation via the post last night a very exclusive invitation
 to a wedding
a friend of mine she's getting married to a woman she met four years ago
sure
i know we'll get to see them kiss
whatever man i bet i won't be the only one taking a picture
being at my first wedding is exciting but also makes me nervous
dromiceiomimus what are you doing here
yeah small world
oh man how do i look
supoib
wait up
well the wedding went off without a hitch
ha ha not counting the slang meaning of 'hitch' of course
what did you think of the wedding dromiceiomimus
i'm on my way there now
i will congratulate them on finding happiness
oh yeah but there's still cake for us right
i love lesbian weddings
this marriage has gotten me thinking about monogamy
i did some research
i found a book called the ethical slut
basically it gives advice for having loving polygamous relationships a lot of it makes sense like say your girlfriend has a best friend and they go out one night you're happy for her right you love her you want her to be happy so why should that change when you add sex to it the book also posits that an artificial 'economy of scarcity' in sex leads to jealousy and possessiveness
yeah
that's what the book says anyway it's not anti monogamy but it is pro polygamy
artificial economy of scarcity my friend like diamonds
who knows
man did you see what that triceratops was wearing at the film last night
you said it
no what was he wearing
w
what's wrong with that
that's the coolest
i once read how to make bombs
that's it the whole internet and you look up salads
is it meat salad
because if not then i doubt it would be a very good salad
today is thanksgiving day
i'm excited i always look forward to all the food you get to eat during thanksgiving
my favourite is mashed potatoes i've left extra room in my stomach for mashed potatoes
sorry to interrupt but i must be on my way i'm having dinner with the utahraptor
huh what do you mean
but that dinner's tonight
aww boo
this time i've disappointed even myself
i stayed at home last night and watched a movie
but as not to appear nerdy i told everyone that i went out clubbing
it was great i had a great time dancing with uh three different women
yeah at once it was awesome i have pictures
sure i'll make enlargements for everyone
and david suzuki was there too i boogied with him
and so you shall
today i am hungry perhaps i could satisfy this hunger by eating
 everyone
dromiceiomimus you look delicious today i would love to have you for dinner tonight
i am going to eat everyone
says you
because i will have eaten them
perhaps i will not eat my friends after all
perhaps
i've come up with some patently absurd ideas that i will pontificate upon only to annoy the utahraptor
i just bet i do this because i'm bored
i'm probably jealous of him too
probably
not that i'd ever tell him that of course i'm too self absorbed
life is great
now i think i'll go stomp on a woman just because she's there
you mean stomping on things
 like this
where the hell is he
today is a good day i think for increasing the integral count of my age
thank you
nope only little babies
i don't know but you'd better hope he likes it
best birthday ever
ahh another relaxing day for me t rex the king of the dinosaurs and the dinosaur of kings
and yet my mighty heart is troubled
what is left for me to do i am king of all that i survey i am the dominant creature on the planet
truly i am the greatest thing ever
i was just saying how great i am
well that's another house gone i seem to be going through houses like other people go through
um
 some manner of disposable goods
i don't believe in karma
so probably not
so
that doesn't imply that there's some cosmic judge keeping score of my actions you're making a logical fallacy namely after which therefore becasue of
yes it is
yep
i tell you man i was all over the logic books in high school
i'm opening up my own detective agency
i'm going to solve mysteries
hello dromiceiomimus do you have any mysteries you'd like solved
excellent
oh boy
you should know i don't take sarcastic cases
only real mysteries please
i heard it was somebody's birthday today
my grandfather's
wow that's exciting i wonder who'll be at the party tonight
will there be cake
i'll show off my balloon animal making skills
what
shoot i'll just have my own party for him then
wow grandfather sure knows how to throw a party
who wants some cake
hallowe'en is coming up
which means of course that i had better get started working on my costume
2 years ago i went as a ninja that was awesome because i got to hit people with my ninja stick
last year i was a bear
that was not so awesome
oh yeah what are you dressing up as
good luck representing that in a way that guys don't find inherently confusing
i need to have the best costume ever this hallowe'en
but i don't want to do something that's been done before
lame
lame
i know i'll go as a robot
what's cooler than a robotic t rex
the evaluation of that statement results in a null output set
input disregarded inferior robotic model
new program engaged 10 ignore what utahraptor says 20 utahraptor is lame 30 goto 10
it's too late line 10 was already interpreted
maybe i'll dress up for hallowe'en as a utahraptor
that's a great idea
then i'll be able to walk up to his friends and insult them they'll think it's he who is the one who is insulting them i could wear this costume all the time
then it's decided i will be a utahraptor for hallowe'en
i'll show you
i just realized that if i transformed what people say to me into something i want to hear i will only hear things that appeal to me
genius
i should have thought of this years ago
hello dromiceiomimus
why yes i am super sexy today
says you
that will be my epitaph then
 here lies t rex who undermined the very foundation of language
awesome
i have been thinking about what the utahraptor said yesterday and by extension the ambiguity allowable in language
take the bible for instance
there's a text passed down for hundreds of generations translated re written re edited
even if you don't assume that it's the word of god the difference in meaning between what was written then and what you read now must be staggering
it's often said that the only way to be immortal is through your words and ideas
but the bible shows us that language is mutable so what's the solution how can i ensure that the ideas i have in my head when i communicate are the same as those you get in yours when you hear me
but how would we write puns in such a language
eh
or delightfully sexy double entendres
everything i have is mine and mine alone
if other people want to use what's mine they will have to get their own
there's only enough for me
sorry
what
i should have been more willing to share
meeting new people can be fun
it can be tiring if you are meeting a lot of new people at once however here are some tips on how to meet lots of people at once
&#8226 wear something that will identify you and make you easy to remember i recommend a crazy scarf or a large disfiguring scar
listen attentively to people's names when you meet them if their name is the same as yours laugh
like when i lost someone's baby
so
polygamy
i've discovered that the problem with researching this sort of thing polygamy the subject of which i am speaking is that everybody has an agenda
it's like vegetarianism all you hear is from the militant extremes meat is murder vegetarians are sissies and it's hard to find a balanced viewpoint
polygamous reading what's next
eh
 what's next
i've discovered something exciting
 writing free form poetry is easy if you just write whatever pops into your head
observe
radiantbox
f
the end
it was awesome
okay it was just a poem i'm not married to it
tonight is a good night i think for having chick peas in coconut milk for dinner
indeed i am the turmeric gives the dish its distinctive yellow colour
how did you know
it does indeed old friend
i think it's time for me to get out and meet some fine new ladies
fine new sexy ladies
any fine new sexy ladies please identify yourselves to me
i will be pleased to seduce you after introductions have been made
i am the strapping young t rex stomping on things
says you if a woman was walking around shouting for fine new sexy dudes she'd be chased by men from all over
i don't get it why isn't this working
 is it me
well i'm perfectly content
i may be a bit idle a bit unfocused but at least i haven't had a night where all sense left my life that's for darn sure incidentally criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot
oh boy
can you get mom to wear her pearl necklace
my parents
i am the last son of the doomed planet of krypton
found adopted and raised by the kindly kent couple who could not have a child of their own i was taught about truth justice and the american way
as i grew i found that i could run faster than a speeding bullet i was more powerful than a locomotive i was able to leap tall buildings in a single bound as so
in times of trouble i am there as superman
no i'm superman clark kent and i are two different people
ha ha ha
anyway i'll tell him you said hi
 green lantern
i'll be honest i haven't read any green lantern comics he's got that power ring right and he can make giant green fists with it and robot suits can he make robot suits sometimes
anyway um one day green lantern found a power ring
yeah yeah that's right it doesn't work on yellow
no argument here
one day green lantern found a power ring and used it to fight crime that wasn't yellow
many people assume the origin of this phrase has to do with testicles
in fact it's quite the opposite the phrase originated with pilots of fighter planes
the balls in question referred to the knobs on top of the plane's throttle control when the throttle was at full the balls would be to the wall of the cockpit
and that's the origin of the phrase balls to the wall
what
hence balls to the wall man
that's sweet
your sense of disenchantment comes from a realization that the world is not as you believed
people lie and get away with it murders go unsolved there are people who only interact with you because they think it might be profitable for them
you were raised on fairy tales where there were no moral grey areas where good and bad were clear where there was never any real doubt over which side would win in the end
each lurid death reported in the paper akes you a little more cynical a little more dead inside
holy
why don't you tell me what you really think
i had the strangest dream last night
it was crazy
or at least i think it was crazy i don't remember much of the dream all i remember is waking up and thinking wow what a crazy dream
i wonder what could have happened
oh well
what it's all i remember
well what are you doing here if we have nothing to talk about
yeah that's what i thought
 garden path sentences are those that trick you into thinking that they will mean one thing but then as you read more of the sentence that meaning is shown to be false
for instance the horse raced past the barn fell
aha my friend so it would seem but it actually refers to a horse which at some point in the past was raced past a barn and now that same horse has fallen over
what are you saying
well they could but they could also say my sentence
sure man all the time
farmer's call them nature's dominoes
many philosophical systems seem predicated on increasing your happiness either of yourself or more globally
i wonder is happiness such a valid goal
furthermore if i had a machine that i could press a button on and it would make me happy perfectly content indistinguishable from the real emotion would i do anything but press the button all day long
it's hard to say
um
yeah i guess you could see it that way
hmm
seeing as i missed thanksgiving last month i am celebrating a new holiday today one which i just invented i call it american thanksgiving
dromiceiomimus would you like to come over tonight for a big american thanksgiving dinner
excellent
well
it's a time for us to reflect on all the great things we have such as food and shelter you spend an evening with friends and family want to come over for american thanksgiving
american thanksgiving is similar but distinct from regular thanksgiving
um well they're both important it's not a song without music but for most songs the words are important too
hmm
oh yeah
suddenly i feel as if my future is full of new choices new directions
my choices are mine to decide
but yet i feel troubled if i make some change in my life what of those i leave behind
i am happy here but i know i won't be happy if i stay here forever leaving becomes a bitter sweet necessity
if only there were some way that i could come back to now some way i could save this world to peek in once in a while
i was just thinking how if i were to leave that would change many things
yeah i guess so
i'm high right now
i wonder what's the best thing that could happen to me today
maybe i could win the lottery
or maybe when i stomp on this house it will crack open to reveal treasure gold doubloons
pirate's doubloons
not true
my fantasies also involved pirates
debateable
forget it i'm sick of everybody acting like they know what's best for me
from no on i'm doing what i feel like when i feel like doing it
and today i feel like stomping on a house full of people i don't know and then i think i feel like finding a loose woman and running off to some tropical country without an extradition treaty where i will set up a home where we can live comfortably and there i'll have sex with this woman
what are you talking about
i never
i never knew my father
i have thought of the perfect prank to play on the utahraptor i will confide in him personal stories about my youth
 stories that it turns out are false
that way years down the road if he ever chances to mention one of these stories i will be able to say got you
he'll say what obviously confused since my prank was years in the making but once i explain that i was in fact lying to him when he though he had my trust he will laugh heartily and concede that i did indeed get him
i do
um
hoisted by my own petard
brrr it's getting cold out
this means that winter is coming
luckily as a warm blooded being this cold weather means little to me
oh
who'd say that
who
i'll kick his ass
i have been thinking and i have come to the conclusion that it would be pretty sweet to be called as a witness in some sort of murder trial
pretty sweet indeed my friends pretty sweet indeed
not hardly but i do want to be able to testify under oath that i t rex am an awesome dude it will go in the official court record it will probably be reported in the papers
what no
no they won't
but wouldn't it be so awesome to discuss your own awesomeness in open court that it would be a special case
i would argue yes
everyone including me is an end in himself not a means to an end for others
this means i should exist for my own sake neither sacrificing myself to others nor sacrificing others to myself the pursuit of my own rational self interest and happiness is the highest moral purpose of my life
if i must deal with others it should be as traders in a pure capitalist system no charity no sympathy just business an exchange of value for value
what do you mean
nope love is selfish you see value in someone and they see value in you you want access to this value so you arrange a spiritual exchange
hey that rhymes
this fallacy is when you assume that since a position is between two extremes it must be right
it seems to occur because often this is the case for instance eating a moderate amount of food is better than eating to excess or eating not at all
however just because a case is between two extremes does not make it automatically correct it must be justified
easy
say you think i should go on a trip around the world while i assure you that i can't afford it and that i should stay home from that we would conclude that i should go on a trip exactly half way around the world where i'd probably run out of money and get stuck
luckily we have arrived to that conclusion via a fallacy so i will be making no such trip
i was asked by a friend of mine how he could tell his sweetheart that he loves her in a new exciting way he's worried that he's said the same old thing too often and that it's getting stale
i assured him that there are infinitely many ways to say i love you
for instance you could say i love you but you could also say i really love you or for that matter i really really love you
therefore since you can have an arbitrary number of 'really's there are an infinite number of ways to say i love you
so
well that explains why that woman at the supermarket never replied to my letters
also they were anonymous
last night it occured to me that an evening at the theatre would be a delightful distraction
however when i arrived they were out of tickets
it's the story of my life
it means that that one incident is indicative of a larger trend in my life
but in a metaphorical sense
you know theatres full no tickets
you were there
any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us
but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance is endless dr prosper lucas's treatise in two large volumes is the fullest and the best on this subject
when a deviation appears not unfrequently and we see it in the father and child we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on
both but when amongst individuals apparently exposed to the same conditions any very rare deviation due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances appears in the parent say once amongst several million individuals and it reappears in the child the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to a
i think it would be nice if i gave presents to people once a year furthermore it would be nice if i did this on a set day
i will call this day dinosaur present day featuring t rex
dromiceiomimus did you know that dinosaur present day featuring t rex is coming up
ho ho ho i get it no present as in the gift
i am
it's a surprise
no
no
i need to think of awesome presents to get all my friends
then i'll go out and buy these gifts i will do this using capitalism
dromiceiomimus if you could have anything in the whole world what would you want
really hmm
i am
i'm worried that my dinosaur present day featuring t rex has become too commercial we've forgotten about the true spirit of the day
that's the magic of dinosaur present day featuring t rex
i've decided that despite the commercialism of the season i will still be giving out presents to all my friends
however i will achieve this by sneaking into their houses and leaving the presents there
dromiceiomimus i think you should examing your house carefully tomorrow morning
i have a hunch you might find some surprises there is all
true
it's no trouble
i just like the excitement of giving people presents
it makes me feel kind of sexy you know
dinosaur present day featuring t rex has been a complete success
people even gave me presents it was awesome
thank you so much for the little gloves dromiceiomimus
nice chocolates for a nice lady
indeed
featuring t rex that would be a lot of presents
yeah man
i am giving a thumbs up
today i am excited today i did not forget my dentist appointment
today i will be the one to impress my dentist with my personal oral hygiene
i spent an hour this morning making sure that my teeth were sparkly clean i practiced in the mirror saying of course i floss after every meal of course doctor i floss after every meal and floss after every meal of course
i practiced until i got it right
not hardly
but every time i go he asks and every time i feel like i let him down personally you know like he has twenty kids and i'm the only one who doesn't floss and he doesn't know why
it gets sadder sometimes i imagine he's bought books on how to get your kid to floss and he's tried everything the books say but still i don't floss and he's started to wonder if there is something wrong with him has he failed me as a dentist as a father where did it all go wrong
i wonder what the longest word in the dictionary is
dromiceiomimus do you know what the longest word in the dictionary is
ha ha no this isn't a riddle it's a real question i'm investigating
what
 smiles
that's it
everybody dies
i wonder what the longest word in the dictionary is
dromiceiomimus do you know what the longest word in the dictionary is
ha ha no this isn't a riddle it's a real question i'm investigating
what
 smiles
that's it
everybody dies
many hundreds of years ago things were done in different ways
many things were more primitive all of the modern conveniences you take for granted did not exist
people died at a younger age
travel was harder and took much longer
why would you say that
then i guess my career as an educator is
 history
new year's resolutions are used to make changes in your life
classically one would make private resolutions and endeavour to carry these out over the new unblemished year however this tradition has changed over time
people now choose to announce their resolutions perhaps in the hopes of making their pledges more likely to be fulfilled worse in some families members make resolutions for each other a recipe for fighting and snide sarcastic suggestions
huh
weren't you listening this will only lead to conflict
no
y you have one prepared
you jerk you brought a list
because the words have two different origins
because that would be impractical
yes boxes
no they would not
argh
i received some excellent news last night that i've been accepted in a part time job at the local middle school grades 6 8
i'll be teaching tweens
then i will be the first
i don't care what she says i'm using the word tweens
not you too
ok tweens i'll be your substitute teacher for today
and i was once a tweenager too so i don't want any tween tricks played on me alright tweens
i feel as if i've spent the past year in some sort of alternate reality indeed if i were to describe my adventures over the past several months i would describe them as
non canon
today is a beautiful day to be stomping on things out here in the real world how are you today gertie
ha ha that of course is my name which is why i am responding to it i'm fine today gertie
hell yes
great i too will bring my wife
ha ha ha
dear seventeen
i was in the garden of eden and i don't know what i was thinking but i ate the forbidden fruit
it was so embarrasing my fave crush was there and he saw everything just when i thought things couldn't get worse god showed up and he kicked us both out of the garden for good i could have died
then when we were outside i suddenly knew shame for the first time and my crush did too i swear i never blushed so much in my enitre life
there is a silver lining though we are now completely in love despite what happened
s sorta
and he never called me again
unicorns and flying submarines are two things that do not exist
other things that don't exist include talking plants and ham and cheese sandwiches that are made out of neither ham nor cheese
these things don't exist
also objectivity
so
at the end i'll have an exhaustive list of things that don't exist then in the future if anybody ever wants to see if something exists they could just consult my list
mine the task eternal
i wonder what the world would be like if i had never been born
i wonder
i do merry christmas what reason have you to be merry you're poor enough
bah humbug
long past
what business brought you here
what the that's not what i wanted to dream about at all
i'm in the prime of life
ha ha ha
hey dromiceiomimus would you say it's great to be young
it's great eh
it sure is
you're right
however that will be more than enough excitement for me
i believe today i will go down to the beach and swim
naked
good morning dromiceiomimus beutiful day isn't it
it is my friend i'm going to swim naked
i am good sir
not at all
why
go naked
i'm swimming naked
winning arguments is easy
the secret is to convince your opponent that arguing with you isn't worthwhile when they abandon the argument/friendship you win
 it's really that easy
no
i specifically specified that it's for winning arguments/friendships
 hmm sounds to me like somebody lost their last few friendships
that's easy
 happy machine
now granted it's not the cutest phrase if you just look at it but if you think about what a happy machine would do what it would look like you end up with something that is just so cute
a happy machine
no
it's a machine to create happiness a happy machine
oh noo
i've made a fantastic discovery a discovery bound to send the music theorists back to their dusty old drawing boards for you see
i've discovered how to turn most any love song into a sea shanty
indeed
easy i simply replace every instance of baby with matey
try it yourself
see
it's amazing
the differences between adults and children are many
for example while adults are by definition fully grown children are much smaller adults have more life experiences than children who may have very little adults legally are fully recognized people while children are not they do not have the same rights
yes there are many differences between adults and children
what is it utahraptor
how embarrassing
well to be fair that is one of the differences between adults and children
as the fantastic fellow that i am i've decided to reward my friends for their hard years of friendship
i will be rewarding them by giving out prizes anything their heart desires
dromiceiomimus i would like to reward you for being my friend what would yo like
is that true could others take my offer of prizes to be an insult
good god you're right let me make this up to you we'll go to the movies
that'll be fun eh
my treat
i find cooties to be an interesting idea we hear about this 'disease' as children and we never forget
nobody wants to have cooties despite the fact that they have no effect on anyone whatsoever
what no i don't have cooties nobody has cooties
no i don't
what's with everyone asking me if i have cooties maybe you have cooties
i'm not
it is clear that i do not in fact have cooties
no don't listen to him
i just realized i'm almost certainly the one person who knows me the best this has many implications
for one it means if i think i'm awesome no one can dispute it because i'm the authority
this is great i intend to make all sorts of pronouncements about myself pronouncements that people will be forced to accept because who would know myself better than me nobody that's who
looks like my weekend just got filled up
i don't see how
it doesn't
i guess you're righ hey
is there some political undertone to what you're saying
i have been secretly programming in my spare time what's more i have completed my first game i call it
 monkey whore
like all my work the exclaimation mark belongs in the title it's that exciting a game
well it's great you start out as a monkey whore and then you collect coins and at the end of the game you are the champion of the monkey whores
i saw it on the internet
i have the basic idea a whore is someone who collects coins yes
holy cow
my game's not appropriate at all
who cares about feelings
i tell it like it is
my lady wouldst thou be so kind as to prepare me my dinner and birth me my babies
you have my thanks
quickly now
what's the secret word
is it still alright to hold a door open for a lady
now that's fair to both genders
who cares about feelings
damn right that's because we're all part of a cybernetic collective consciousness
i have finished a new novel this is my best novel yet for the simple reason that it includes one critical aspect
a sex scene
yep it's hot if i do say so myself
shit i hadn't thought of that
damn damn damn what am i going to do i'm doomed
not as such
i i guess so
i'm sabotaging my own life
today i am not going to make any decision except for this decision just now not to make any decisions
this is great i can't be held responsible for my actions
dromiceiomimus should i stomp this house fast or should i stomp this house slow
i'm sorry but please limit your answers to the suggestions provided
oh
oh man i should totally become the ultimate personification of society everything i did would be instantly symbolic
imagine the symbology if i committed suicide
with the tv on
 houston we have a problem
ha ha ha
hey dromiceiomimus these people in this house you know what they're saying
 houston we have a problem
ha ha ha
 houston we have a problem
 houston we have a problem little lady
like what
 houston we have a problem
ha ha ha
we can't trust our senses the entire world could be an illusion
oh well it doesn't really matter either way i suppose
you misrepresent the science all vantage points are relative however this does not mean that all things are relative that would be absurd
but please continue to take simplified scientific results and apply them naively to philosophical thought
with new understandings coming from the field of science we no longer have to give god all the credit for creating the universe
it's great
in the past we did not have a very good understanding of our world and so attributing storms and such to god made sense
but now we understand things we don't need a god to make hurricanes and babies for us we can make them in a lab
in effect we and by 'we' i mean 'dinosaurs' have become the all powerful gods of old
i don't see how
well i still have plenty more proof that god doesn't exist remember all those emails i sent him back in december
they bounced
well i'm perfectly content
yes indeed life is good
wait what's this
a growth on my leg
run away
wait what are we running from
shit no
i've decided that i will put my tremendous height strength abilities intellect and colour to good use
i will become
a superhero
first i need a secret identity but i've already god that then i need an origin story but i can figure that out later what's most important is fighting crime
silence citizen
no you're stealing my idea
no but i was going to
no fair i was going to ask her to be my sidekick
you can't just
my base is going to be better
i have heard of the perfect way for one and all of ones friends to be the classiest group of people ever
how to appear to be classy
the secret is the handshake if you greet all of your friends with a handshake then without fail people will start commenting on how classy you are
this is going to be great
and when people do compliment me on my classiness i'll shake their hand
i do believe i am
but you didn't shake my hand just now it is less classy to run up behind someone shouting than to give them a firm handshake
ready
ha ha here i go
valentine's day
 oh no
i need to find myself a valentine stat
aww of course i'll be your valentine dromiceiomimus
sure
but before you say anything i want to share with you some happy news that dromiceiomimus wanted to be my valentine
stupid manufactured holidays
i have recently discovered a new philosophical system of beliefs
buddhism
buddhism allows me to forgo material things
all i have to do is sit around all day and think then i become enlightened
it is a sweet deal
truly buddhism is the way for me
huh
i also saw a statue
 you know how sometimes you wonder what your life would be like if only you made some decisions differently
 well i intend to find out
 it'll be great i'll move to a new town and start over then every chance i have i'll make the other decision the one i didn't make the first time
 it'll be great and if things turn out worse with these new decisions well then lesson learned i'll just move back here and never speak of it again
 then it's settled i'll move to a new town make new friends and start a whole new identity
 why
 ha ha
 no i didn't commit some horrible crime
 right
i have finally decided to add another word to my list of favourite words
the word
sesquipedalian
the reason this word is so great is that it means given to the overuse of long words and it itself is a long word
i can't get enough
yep
is that alright
alright then
i'm glad we had this little talk
it's been a memorable two weeks indeed
do you recall a few days ago when we had that hilarious conversation
i um
line
so what meaning do you see my actions representing
oh man
now i um
line
i have been thinking of registering a domain name
 on the internet
this domain name will have to be something that reflects me and my interests
something that says this is an awesome dude but also says you should sign the guestbook
hmm
oh boy what is it
that's perfect
who wants some ice cream
dromiceiomimus come over tonght i'm going to have an ice cream night
yeah we'll all go out for ice cream it'll be fun
ice cream
it is
it's so beautiful you should come over tonight for ice cream
you know it
shit it's still winter
so if you'll excuse the pun i think you'll agree one cannot have a will to something without first a will through something yes
utahraptor
utahraptor
where the hell did he go he was right here
we were talking
i was being clever
where were you
r really
since when do you smoke
since when
 i can't believe the utahraptor's a smoker i can't believe it
 doesn't he know he's damaging his lungs
 dromiceiomimus did you know that the utahraptor is a smoker
 you smoke too i could stomp a house i'm so shocked
 my shock is continued
 maybe i'll just like the taste of burying your ass
 you heard me
i guess i shouldn't freak out too much about people smoking i'm not sure if it's my place i'll try to be more cool about it
plus i don't want to become a big old sanctimonious bastard
so dromiceiomimus how long have you been smoking
wait you drink
am i a prude am i out of touch with the youth of today
i i just would prefer it if you'd consider quitting the habit
that's right
i said it
who said that
oh yeah prove it what am i going to do next
ha i'd like to see that
oh my goodness he was right
god
god's talking to me and he can tell the future
hah hah hah no way
hello everybodee
this is a very dull panel what is on the next panel
what did that say did that say there will be a dinosaur at the end of this comic
it did oh i am so scared of dinosaurs
listen i have an idea if you do not read any panels we will never get to the end of this comic
and that is good because there is a dinosaur at the end of this comic
so please do not read the next panel
maybe you do not understand you do not know what you are doing to me
i t rex am begging you not to read the next panel
oh i am so scared please do not read the next panel please please please
well look at that this is the end of the comic and the only one here is me
i lovable scaly old t rex am the dinosaur at the end of this comic
and you were so scared i told you and told you that there was nothing to be afraid of
 here is a list of things that i've burnt
 toast

 rubber
 which
 oh that's very funny utahrapt
 look out behind you
how can i possibly be late for my important meeting again
how is this even possible
i got up early i ate breakfast early i showered early and yet i am late again still
why i am always late for my very important meetings
i do not understand this
if there were an award for lateness i would be the winner two years in a row
hello utahraptor how are you today
oh ha ha don't worry about me
it's just something i have to take care of you know
last night i built myself a machine
 a time machine
this time machine is a watch one that allows me to travel through time at the fantastic rate of one second per second
it will show me what tomorrow is like tomorrow
 what a great adventure
hey
what
ack
i'm going to write my autobiography but rather than writing it myself
i'm going to get lots of other people to write it for me

i think it will be and flattering too
huh
what i don't smell funny on tuesdays

i'm going to write my autobiography but rather than writing it myself
i'm going to get lots of other people to write it for me

it gives him dominion over the minds of men and his absolute power has corrupted him absolutely
somehow somehow we've got to stop him the fate of the free world depends on it
no you'll never get away with this
i

because i'm a carnivore
no way i might accidentally hurt some rabbits
 which would actually be okay because as a carnivore i eat rabbits
but
wha
the plight of the lower class will never be understood by the wealthy
today gentle reader of the comic in which i am a character perhaps the title character we are going to break the 4th wall
we may in fact be doing it now
n no
oh no
what's all this then i appear to be made of crude sticks and dots and i feel mildly chunky
alternate universe
dromiceiomimus in this universe instead of being my ex girlfriend you are a street wisened homicide detective named lenny
i will be a racially stereotyped informant named miguel sanchez
oh yeah well
the lion king is a great movie
it has everything a good movie needs
plus a beautiful message without making the movie too corny
yup great movie it was
that wasn't in the movie
 gasp
i may look different but i assure you
i am as much myself as i have ever been
why i still take immense pleasure in stomping on this conveniently placed log cabin
and of course a young lady that is in a prime position for a good stomping herself
this cannot beee
raaaarg
indeed i have indeed i have
stomp harder
know what i hate comics that break the fourth wall
damn straight
it's cheap lazy writing by talentless hacks with no creative muscle
you heard me if anyone were to debase this comic with cheap fourth wall jokes i would crush not only this house and family but the fourth wall joke teller him or herself that is the extent of my rancor and wrath
take that self aware nincompoops feel the foot wrath of my feet
i must have taken a wrong left turn near albuquerque
because now i am trapped in contradiction city
i should go
but i can't
and why not
i'm waiting for godot
you're sure it was here
that we were to wait
i don't know a willow
it must be dead
or perhaps it's not the season
a shrub
godot where were you
okay time to get down to some squashing hey what gives what's with the word balloon and the jester regular font
there's only four panels no little people no dromiceiomimus and we look all different everything's changed
let's eat a flintstone
something's wrong today
things are not the way they should be
i usually star in the first panel then you my sidekick come only three panels later
but there you are today
and all panels are identical
you should be
what the
no we're saved
it always ends in the sixth panel
well
i can't i'm stuck here
and i'm not gay
i am such a great t rex
in fact i must be the greatest t rex in the world
hey dromiceiomimus look at me as i crush this small building don't you think i possess the greatest building crushing form in the world
what by ok do you mean great and by i guess do you mean know with absolute certainty if so then i agree
utahraptor take a look at what i'm going to do to this unsuspecting woman
my stomp exhibits far more grace than any other t rex just another example of why i'm the greatest
what
i must defeat him
i would like to start a biscuits and gravy club
i love biscuits and gravy
i believe i would call it get biscuits pal or go to an early gravy
it does
at least we can agree on one thing
biscuit fever is here to stay
i've been practicing a little something in my spare time
mime
/ t rex amazing eh dromiceiomimus
driving a car uncanny yes don't worry there is no invisible car
oh yeah you can do better
oh whatever
whatever man
that's nothing you wanna see what driving a car really looks like
beep beep
i have received a stern letter from the government they are angry because i didn't pay my taxes last year well guess what government
last year is now officially non canon
i got the idea from tv from now on whenever something i don't like happens to me i'll just declare it to be non canon
so far
sure i can i just did
remember that time i got beat up in grade 2 guess what it's not canon anymore and remember that time i lost a baby guess what
correct
in summary any event in which i was embarrassed is now non canon
i've also retroconned my name to be mister awesome by the way
jealous
the identity theory is that all states of the mind are identical to all states of the brain
my sense of self itself is nothing more than the physical state of the chemicals and neurons in my stately skull
it does
but it's not that simple
dude i don't even know what that is
i've had a great idea i'm going to convince one of my friends that i have a magical ring but the catch is the ring only works if you are pure of heart
so this friend of mine will undergo a regime of self improvement
however when they finally have bettered themselves and are pure of heart they will realize that there was no magic ring the magic was in them all along
sure it does it's a magic ring
sure
actually i was hoping i'd run into you i have a magic ring that i'd like to give to you but the catch is it only works if you are pure of heart
well would&#8211
would you like another
it's my favourite season
spring
in spring you get flowers popping up new fresh air young lovers walking hand in hand
it's all very pretty
perhaps
it's just like i wish i were part of that young couple walking hand in hand you know
yeah
anyway who cares it's spring
yes it's spring time to go for long walks in the springtime sun
it's extra nice since today i have a full stomach life is good
fancy meeting you here dromiceiomimus out for a walk in the springtime
it is a popular pasttime on the first warm day of the year
ha ha yep sure did
you went to the washroom and i was hungry let us just enjoy this fine day together
whoah hold up
 scallywag
i've come across a way of making any otherwise simple sentence sinister and creepy the secret is simple
the secret is whispering
it works as follows assume it's your birthday today dromiceiomimus if i were to say happy birthday dromiceiomimus that would sound normal yes
but check out what happens if i whisper
 happy birthday dromiceiomimus
okay i'll try
 that shirt looks good on you utahraptor
 it looks good on your body
see creeeeepy
cut and save
eating vegetables can be a pain for today's breed of young cool somehow single men
the trick dromiceiomimus is not to make vegetables fun nothing makes vegetables fun except using them as weapons carrot swords etc
the trick is to put all the vegetables into one easy to make delicious dish
well i'm glad you asked
cover and cook over medium heat until the potatoes are soft
awesome okay once more from the top
this is going to be the best talent show ever
the gambler's fallacy is when one assumes that a deviation from what occurs in the long term
 will be corrected in the short term
this is most often seen when people play games of chance they'll assume that say since they've had such bad luck with rolls of the dice recently they are somehow due for a good roll
however in most cases things are independent the results of the previous roll has no bearing on the current roll
well
whatever

 oh man
 khaaaaaaaaan
 hah hah ok you are my son david and we are trying to locate the genesis device which has been stolen and which has the awesome power to reshape worlds
 i just hope my arch nemesis khan a genetically engineered superman from earth's eugenic wars of the 1990s doesn't show up
 i stranded him on a planet years ago and he never forgets a face
 khan
 not if i disable your ship first
 scotty i need war speed in three minutes or we're all dead
 although i somehow feel as though we'll warp away just as genesis goes off and that spock will die at the end needs of the many
no
have you dromiceiomimus
yeah
 sigh
 yeah me too
i say we kill all of them
meeting adjourned
i demand instant gratification
i'm not gratified
maybe instant gratification isn't
dromiceiomimus how long have you been standing there
those were my private thoughts she had no right to tell you
haha i guess i was being kind of silly
listen though don't tell my mom okay
i've bought myself a new means of transportation
a bicycle
do you want to go on a bike ride dromiceiomimus
you can watch me
great
we can race we'll ring our little bells as we zoom by pedestrians making their hair swoosh in the direction of our travel
oh really i think you might find you spoke too soon my friend
that's a bicycle pun by the way
 you can use it if you want
i've entered a poetry contest
i can't lose
right dromiceiomimus i'm a good poet right
i can assure you that my poetry is great unlike our current department of state
it's how i express myself
i can do both observe
i like the flowers and the sky they light up my spirit and let it fly they keep my happiness in high supply
unlike our current political leadership
the end by t rex ps my soul is chaos
ladies please one at a time
dromiceiomimus
dromiceiomimus you've got to help me i've doused myself in a chemical i discovered that makes me seem irresistible to women only i've become too irresistible it's out of control
oh no it's affected her too
i'm doomed
utahraptor
you've got to help me utahraptor i don't know what to do
it's a stupid fantasy it doesn't even make sense
i mean a chemical that makes me seem irresistible to women what is that reverse alcohol
i like to keep my sexual fantasies grounded in good science thanks
spurred by an insatiable need to better myself i have taken up a new sport
that sport my friends is fisticuffs
do you think i would be good at fisticuffs dromiceiomimus
boxing the word is a seventeenth century alliteration of 'fisty' of the fists and 'cuff'
so
cheerfully conceded
what are you talking about my arms are powerhouses
vestigial powerhouses
my fists are named knuckles and chuckles for your information
spread it around dig
okay so here's the plan i send cards to all my friends giving them the first clue on a treasure hunt
then they go on the treasure hunt
each clue leads them to a further clue in a new location sending them on an across town adventure
the final clue leads them to my house where they find not only a party with potato chips and barbecued corn but also the moral that the real treasure is friendship
 i like all my parties to have morals at the end
oh boy this treasure hunt which i have just explained in detail including the twist at the end will be great
yeah like in the fifties everybody was neighbourly in the fifties
and all the men wore hats while the women baked pies sure we had the stability we craved after the turmoil of wwii but at what cost repression both sexual and sociological left lasting scars leading in many ways to the cultural self doubt of the 60s but who cares we've got to plan this party
so i've laid out all the clues around town and i've got the party and barbeque all set up
i think we're good to go
is everything ready dromiceiomimus
excellent nothing could possibly go wrong not even god himself can wreck this party now
the party it's ruined
wait did you check the cupboard above the fridge i usually keep some cups there
ha ha super
for a second there i thought that god himself had wrecked our party but nope not this time ladies
yes my friends i would have to confess
last night was the best party ever
wouldn't you agree dromiceiomimus you seemed to be having a great time at the party last night
a corker what does that mean
i know
i listened to a bit of it one album was quite the corker
i did in fact i thought all the music you brought over were corkers
 corker means something is really good
hah hah imagine if we were at a vineyard
yesterday was a very special day for many people
yesterday was mother's day
did you give your mom some flowers for mother's day dromiceiomimus
excellent and attached to the flowers a note
lots
i got her some seeds she likes to garden and some chocolate she likes chocolate and a card i made with a drawing of me hatching from my egg
yeah but when you open it it's actually a robot version of me and i'm shooting red lasers from my eyes that spell out happy mothers day
 mom said it was very creative
you know what's the best thing ever
the word bicurious
it's funny when people use it because how long can you be bicurious you don't sit around all day saying hmmm i wonder what will happen you look it up on the internet or you go out meet someone in the gender you're interested in and then afterwards roll over and say curiosity satisfied
then it's high fives all around
you could say it like curiosity satisfied
it's a great word
i almost wish i was bicurious just so i could say curiosity satisfied
i'd say it like
 curiosity satisfied
 bicurious
hee hee
i can't get enough
the sad thing is that the word is rarely used sincerely anymore the only place you see it is in those sleazy newspapers with back page advertisements for bicurious teens bicurious teens don't need to advertise
holy shit single bicurious lesbians
oh hey utahr
wh
did you just squeeze my bum
 bicuriosity satisfied more like bicuriosity disappointed by a fumbling and frankly clumsy grope
that's right my friend
clumsy
oh boy today is a good day i think for an adventure through time
so long dromiceiomimus i'm about to travel back to the age of di back to long ago
well okay
but you have to promise to let me choose the time period and you're not allowed to try to set things up so you become king alright
cause i read your weblog last week and you were all i want to go back in time and set it up so i become king
your current mood was 'kingly'
i thought to myself t rex you'd better make a note of this
who knew that designing a functional time machine was so difficult
not me that's for darn sure
no it's freaking impossible to build a time machine my enthusiasm yesterday was clearly unwarranted
i know and i'm sorry
but you're the skeptical one you should have realized that i couldn't invent a time machine overnight
 aww
 alright so i'd like to build a time machine for utahraptor so he'll feel better but building one is clearly way too hard
 clearly way way too hard
 b busy
 maybe they're wearing their invisibility suits
 or maybe all my friends are tourists from the future sent to observe me
 good morning say if you were sent from the future to observe me you'd let me know right
 robot suits
 you're crazy
now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and i'd like to take a minute just sit right there
i'll tell you how i became the prince of a town called b el air
in west philadelphia born and raised on the playground was where i spent most of my days chillinh out maxin' relaxing all cool and all shooting some b ball outside of the school when a couple of guys they were up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood i got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said
i whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
if anything i could say that this cab was rare but i thought nah forget it yo home to bel air
looked at my kingdom i was finally there to sit on my throne as the prince of bel air

awesome okay what was it you wanted to talk about

you act as if the purpose of my life is to entertain others
any changes to dates are subject to availability
you know what's funny
death
hah hah cause you're just walking along and then it's whoops i'm dead
eh dromiceiomimus
 whoops
what death
well my friend that depends did i die in a funny way for instance did i smoke a cigarette and then my eyes exploded
hah hah the dangers of smoking
seriously though you should quit
what's for dinner tonight t rex
well t rex i don't know
what would you like t rex
i always choose what's for dinner t rex you decide tonight
hmm in that case t rex let's have nachos tonight it'll be fun
why's that
don't talk to me about societal norms we walk around naked
observe
okay so who wants to join my bluegrass band
i have decided that i am starting a bluegrass band
dromiceiomimus do you know how to play any bliuegrass instruments do you know how to play the banjo or fiddle or a mandola
then i am sorry but you cannot be in my bluegrass band
the band is called burned bluegrass and i play the lyrics
yes i will be honest with you i am new to this band thing
however i do know what i like at present i like the idea of starting a bluegrass band
hah hah who knows what tomorrow will bring
i certainly didn't sneak into the utahraptor's house and eat his food again that's for darn sure
blaming others removes suspicion from myself
dromiceiomimus are those crumbs on your chin did you sneak into the utahraptor's house and eat his food
i don't know seems to me like maybe you did
who me
hah hah yep
dinosaurs were giant ferocious lizards
they were a constant threat to everyone around them they were known to destroy human property with impunity
dinosaurs were also known to destroy human life with impunity
yes indeed i'm experimenting with it
yes well it seemed like a good idea at the time
or should i say it will have been seeming like a good idea at the time
perhaps not
hey i wonder if i got any emails while i was out
oh boy emails
what no emails
dromiceiomimus how come you never send me any emails
i want emails
but i already do
i sent you four surveys and an email where if i forwarded it some charity would get 3 cents and a list i found of reasons why t rexes are better than utahraptors green is the new black
do you mean to imply that t rexes are not better than utahraptors
because if so i would advise you to check your email
hey i wonder if i got any emails while i was out
oh boy emails
what no emails
dromiceiomimus how come you never send me any emails

so the rajasaurus down the street and i went out for dinner last night it was great
it was an oppertunity for me to showcase my sparkling wit
for instance she mentioned how even though she had been raised outside of the indian subcontinent by non traditional parents she still really liked indian food
i put down my fork and said that was good since anything she ate would be by definition indian food
 she's indian
i know
that's the joke i made
thanks
hah hah
okay
i'm midtown high's only professional wallflower
oh boy a science demonstration what's this a spider
ha ha that's ok while i have recently gained the proportional speed and strength of a spider not to mention my keen spider sense from now on i just look out for number one that means me
save your breath buddy
i've got things to do
oh i'm sure i'll learn that in time for instance if that thief went on to kill my uncle ben then that moral would certai
 would certainly present itself
i'm just fine
i said i'm fine
 and so the reason i 'look a little down' is that suddenly everybody's talking about me and acting so concerned for my feelings it's unnerving and it makes me mad
i do that anyway you know that
you heard right my friend
talking about it is what's made me angry
so no
homecare is when doctors or nurses visit you in your own home
while some feel this leads to better care and increased comfort for patients
 others feel it places an unnecessary strain on our already burdened hospitals and health care system
i have none
i feel as though i haven't considered enough information in order to form a defensible point of view
fuck homecare
i note that it is certainly windy out today
holy cow we should go fly kites
dromiceiomimus want to go fly a kite with me
we'll make them all we need are some sticks fabric string ingenuity
you do
wow you know you never cease to surprise me my friend i thought i was breaking new ground by having an interest in kites but here it turns out you have ample experience
i've planted a garden around my house and it is very pretty
best garden ever if i do say so myself
do you have a garden dromiceiomimus
is it nice dromiceiomimus
glad to hear it dromiceiomimus
aww you wrecked it
we were playing a game you were supposed to say my name at the end of each sentence

 l'esprit d'escalier means literally the wit of the staircase
 it's french
it refers to when you think of a witty comeback too late and you've already left the room
of course this idea is largely alien to me as i'm never at a loss for a witty riposte
however it seems for others thinking of the perfect comeback hours or even days later is a more than rare occurrence
as usual
i would
thanks
sure thing dude
oh kay
damn it it's too hard to find temple building materials
ah forget it i was going to build a temple for god but it's too hard i will simply violate our verbal contract
whoops
i had some companions over to my house last night and gave them a tour it was a smashing success except for one thing
some of them thought that my rooms lacked identity
when i politely pressed them to explain they said that while the rooms were decorated nicely they were decorated generically and little to off that was unique to me
a little miffed a little peeved a little upset
you haven't seen them
well do you want to come over now
i like the white
i declare this to be stomp on houses day
whoooo
hey there
i can't hear you
i have been wondering what it would be like if people could save and restore their life just like in a computer game
things would be different
i predict every guy would when he has his first sweetie break up with him spend years restoring to an earlier point trying to find a way to get it to work
additionally i would use this power to save my game tell people off then restore
the only problem is everyone would always eventually have the perfect comeback
sure they would
you know how sometimes you save at a bad point and it's half a second before you're going to die and you keep restoring but there's nothing you can do
well i guess you could just restore to an earlier save point
i have failed to prove my point
okay um okay
 i i've been awakened by nuclear testing um
 rawr
 oh boy i see in the distance a villag city that i can destroy
 look out humanity for i embody um
right right look out humanity i embody post war nuclear paranoia
was that okay
what that was perfect
i did
what
 i believe i shall take a brief repose to calm my agitated nerves
 ah 'tis something soothing to discover yourself engaged in something you very much enjoy
 stomping for me is one such pass time
 what knavery
 why we dined together just a fortnight ago did we not
 i remember it well i had a disappointing dish of cuttlefish
 do you not recall how i remarked on my disappointment
it's the perfect plan
and so simple
whenever i don't want to face my problems i'll send in my stead a cardboard cutout of myself
ideally he'll have an intense yet thoughtful expression on his face people will say oh i'd better just leave t rex alone he's intense yet thoughtful
i do
 just a little closer
credit card fraud is a growing problem in today's society
i believe the fault of this lies in the inherent design flaws of the credit card system if i give a credit card to someone that should authorize one purchase for a specific amount at that specific time instead knowing someone's credit card information allows you to make charges to it for any amount at any time all over the world
like what
but i don't know how to solve that problem i do have opinions about the broken credit card infrastructure however
it's my blessing and my curse
two chicks at once
hah hah awesome
dromiceiomimus do you think it's cool to do two chicks at once
okay it's cool to do two women at once
fine
it's cool to do two non gender identified people at once
then we're agreed
hey ladies
historically speaking all i know are broad stereotypes for instance most people in the middle ages all wore dumpy clothes and spent all day hoeing
now i know that can't be accurate
what i need is some cultural context but it seems like most of that is lost what was it like living as a teenager 40 years ago i have no idea and anyone who did know has now grown up so they don't really know either on account of memories altering over time
so much information is lost
and that's beautiful
hmm i guess this is why people keep diaries to fight against this inexorable loss
too bad they lose
i have finally completed my theory of everything toiling in selfless unappreciated obscurity
surely a little recognition is more than i could ever hope for
thank you i did only what came naturally to me
well ok let's hug
a nobel prize you shouldn't have
i finally figured out how to gain the upper hand on that stupid utahraptor i will adopt for my own the philosophy of pragmatism
from now on i'll be sticking to things that work
for instance some might say that the destruction of this log cabin violates fundamental principles but if i were to show that it is a necessary means to a noble end such arguments are revealed to be petty and ideological
pragmatism
similarly
according to your fancy logic perhaps but i happen to live in the real world
you're just jealous because you didn't think of it first
disastrous events seem less horrible when they happen a as part of an ongoing process over time
b to people we do not usually identify with and
c far away
that's why we are shocked and horrified by a shoot out at the local cafeteria but barely bat an eyelid when we read in the paper that 20 000 bangladeshi have drowned in the pacific it's just the way of things
um that's right i was thinking of something else
yeah see
it's funny because it's far away
today is a good day i think for stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp and eggs
minus the eggs
lovely stomp wonderful stomp little house how would you like a moderate dose of stompage today
don't mention it
stomp stomp
those pirates should have used more permanent structures for reference
like trees
i had the most disturbing thought today
by being true to yourself you are forever derivative
novice artists spend years looking for their own voice only to find they've painted themselves into a corner or waited for a bus that never comes and what of myself do i stomp tis house because i want to or because i can't think of anything else
there i did it again
to be free we must give ourselves up to being totally protean and chameleonic
oh yeah
maybe i'll expect a new format of rebuttal from you next time
charles babbage spent a lot of his time working on mechanical calculating engines
these were machines that could add and subtract and later multiply and divide through repeated addition and subtraction forecasting in many ways the design of modern day computers
unfortunately the machines with thousands of tiny gears and cogs were too complex beyond his means to fully manufacture at the time early 1800s
while some see babbage as the father of modern computers he had little actual influence
indeed
this concludes the brief history of charles babbage and his wonderful calculating engines
it's time to make some changes around here some things have been allowed to slide for too long
but rather than point out the failings of others i will first endeavour to improve myself
off improving myself
yep ask me anything
brussels
this contest doesn't even make sense in the first place
sexual ambiguity
what's it all about
i mean
am i right
hmm
well come on
sexual ambiguity
what's it all about
god how's it going
good to hear it
yep things are pretty okay so um any particular reason why we're talking
oh no
don't worry god and i will help you look for your bike
he doesn't do that anymore
i have an idea for the ultimate disaster movie basically what happens is the earth stops dead in its orbit one day and everybody flies into a wall
 or if they're outside into the sky
hah hah
best movie ever
so it'd be told in a series of shorts each short starts a little before everybody flies into a wall and ends with everybody flying into a wall
it would be so good you start out small regular people a fat guy at a buffet building up to a parking lot full of cars tumbling into the sky the star quarterback kicking the ball and then he and everybody else in the game flying up after it
i know
no way the viewers would know what's going on after the first few shorts so you play off those expectations like there's this shot of a really elaborate wedding and the audience is all oh man all those people are going to fly into a wall so hard
and then we cut to years afterwards when they're old and stooped holding hands out on the porch and then the earth stops in its orbit and they fly off together into the sky
hah hah two tickets please
i submit that there are a finite number of songs therefore the art of writing music is the art of exploring a closed space of possibility
consider the following
there are effective limits on what constitutes music if we take a week as a very generous upper bound on the length of one song then we have a temporal limit furthermore since our ears are not able to distinguish between very similar tones we do not have a continuum of notes but rather a finite set therefore there are only so many songs that can be written
surely not
almost but there are still effective limits therefore finite number of songs
or are there
computers store information in binary code which is a series of 1s and 0s
in fact all information in a computer text video sound even pornographic images are stores in the same fashion as 1s and 0s here's the interesting part
any series of 1s and 0s can be converted quite easily into a regular number so for instance your favorite song is contained quite literally in one single 4 million digit number
quit right
you can't copyright a fact like a number but you can copyright a creative work like a song or a piece of software but since one can be transformed into another copueight law is logically incoherent
but being really cool is one of the perks of being a computer scientist
okay so we covered how everything in a computer is stored in binary code
and we covered how any series of binary digits called bits can be transformed into a number but these numbers are really large they take a long time to send to someone luckily it's possible to send any number and therefore any file of any size using only two
single
bits
what
well yeah
yeah but there's more to being smart than knowing compression schemes
okay so i can accept that nobody applauds at the end of a film anymore
 even though it is the classy thing to do
but what is up with the staff coming in to clean up before the credits are even half over that's just rude
i like them
it gives me time to think about the movie i just saw
this is why we can't see movies together
hey
stay away from women named susan
i like my women like i like my cars
expensive
i like my women like i like my cars
good one um
low maintenance
hee hee
manageable
eww
it's back
and i've learned my lesson always listen to others
i represented vanity
i've never seen the world but that's going to change
 today
dromiceiomimus i am going to go on a trip around the world would you like to be my travelling companion
ha ha little does she know
little does the dromiceiomimus know that i intend to show her the great vistas of the world and by doing so make her fall in love with me
wait
it's been done before
 the other day i heard a math joke that i just had to share so there's this party right
 a party of functions
 all of the functions are there e^x pi r^2 i^2 even some old school guys like abs x anyway poor e^x is alone in a corner acting all morose his good friend 2^x comes over and says what's the problem come on integrate yourself into the party and e^x looks at him and he says why it's not going to make a difference
 hah hah
 we are
 i didn't know you liked math jokes
 boo
 that's it
 friendship annulled
dear recipient of this comic
whoever sent this to you thinks you are great
let's assume this person is a guy boy does he ever like you he likes you so much he lets someone else do his writing for him and uses pre packaged sentimen
 but that's not the point
the point is this card is to tell you that you are great
nothing
nope
dear recipient of this comic whoever sent this to you thinks you are great
 life is a neoclassical pastiche
this is gold
dromiceiomimus would you agree that life is a neoclassical pastiche
well dromiceiomimus i think it's pretty clear
ah yes indeed life is a neoclassical pastiche and i a great philosopher
oh yeah let's put it to the public shall we
somebody say yes
lolita light of my life fire of my loins my sin my soul
ha ha so seriously i have a thing for 12 year old girls i'm ashamed of it and yet
 and yet i certainly enjoy marrying widows in order to gain access to their pubescent daughters
oh but i love her my lolita
i love her so much that i never let her out of my sight and try to keep her locked in the house as much as possible and i deny her her allowance if she in her childish way won't give me certain favours my love for her is that powerful
she ran away
another beautiful day such nice sun a fresh scent in the air and i'm out for a walk
yes indeed it's good to be young
hmm but would it be better to be both young and in love
 sigh
life is beautiful but sad sometimes
 explore your feelings shuck that jive man feelings are for sissies and the elderly
whom it's worth noting i respect
attracting women is easy
personally i rely on my rugged physique and piercing orange eyes in which because they are so deep and soulful one feels they could drown coupled with my delightful conversational skills and coquettish flair
true
in that case i would advise them to meet women on the internet
yes
if you don't have the internet put up flyers around town
this weekend i go on a trip i trip down south
another friend of mine is getting married
the only thing i'm worried about is the dancing i have such big manly feet that sometimes they get in the way
oh would you
whoo
thanks
now all the pretty girls will want to dance with me for sure
oh man best wedding ever
and with my new dance moves i tore up the dance floor
i was until you asked hmmm
it went fine
but i'm beginning to suspect that the dance moves were in me all along
are you sure cause i sure felt like i was the king of the dance that night
to clarify i meant to imply that the king of the dance was self taught
i should have mentioned that sooner otherwise my statement makes less sense
genius only i don't wear pants
you know that god
listen god
utahraptor am i glad to see you listen can you explain to god that his joke would be funny if we wore pants but we don't wear pants so he can stop talking about it
well
yes indeed if i were the last man on earth
 things would be different
hi i'm the last man on earth
would you say you and your girlfriends find that attractive
aww why'd you do that i was imagining i was the last man on earth
heh well you know me
always up to my old tricks
it's a real shame that all those great careers i wanted as a child will probably never come true for me i'll never get to be an austronaut a race car driver or a movie star
it's a sad realization i always sort of hoped such a job would just fall into my lap
sometimes but i don't have a very good imagination for that sort of thing what would i be a romantic lead
mostly i just insert myself into the commercials of my youth
oh that's original
i was your teachah
bugsy brown
i am sick of cold emotionally distant women
that is in theory
in practice i guess i would need more experience with women emotionally distant or otherwise
no
just you know in general i wasn't talking about anyone in particular
hi megan
presentism is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present
its danger is not just that it is often self congratulatory but also that judging historical figures by present day moral standards is likely not a fruitful line of inquiry what we see as questionable say sexism would have seemed completely routine to someone brought up in such a time and we can't really blame historical figures i think for not questioning it
huh
anyway in conclusion presentism has good points and bad points and is not as interesting as i thought it was
stupid futurists
they think they're so great just because they talk about the future all day long ooh look at me i think that the future will have internet robot nano maids put me on the news anyone can call themselves a futurist it doesn't mean anything
argh i even hate the term futurist
they pus my buttons is all
i think it's because most of the predictions are either really dumb or blindingly obvious
yeah full of internet robot nano maids
historiography is the history of history and includes the study of how history is understood
we tend to think that history is just a record of what goes on in the past but this overlooks the fact that two different people can view the same event and even the same series of events differently
for instance is history the story of progress from savage to cultured man is it rather the study of great men and their characters perhaps it is the story of cultural challenge and response
sorry
most of these theories of history are over 50 years old and reflect the sexism in the language at the time
i had to be careful not to let him know i'd considered this situation before
ha ha
h how do you mean
so wait what am i out for i remember meaning to pick something up but now i can't remember what
was it batteries maybe
why am i here
i actually meant my question in the most basic sense but i want to appear deep i'd better act angsty and play along
oh my existential angst is there no happiness without knowledge of purpose
ha ha yeah that sounds good
so heck batteries
whoo does anybody here like to party
does anybody here like to stomp on houses
if so then i propose you join my party featuring t rex whoo
stomping on houses
extreme
as usual
nope my parties only ever go up notches they go all the way to the top extreme
extreme
so i accept that i am the epitome of the male form with typical grace but what is with my getting a sunburn
huh
clearly my body is underevolved being able to be burnt by the sun which i don't have to remind you dromiceiomimus shines on the earth every day seems to be a pretty big limitation
my brain rejects that sentence as semantically invalid
oh no
i would be doomed to being a second tier character in my own life no one including myself would care what i was up to when there was someone exactly like me only he didn't get sunburns
aw boo
my favourite cross cutting technique of all time
why the circle wipe
i can't get enough all you have to do for comedic gold is have someone say boy i sure hope
then we have a circle wipe to 8 hours later and
g
i was just talking about my favourite cross cutting technique of all time already
already i had covered that material
already
hm maybe social relationships would be much easier if everyone said exactly what they were thinking
this gives me an idea my idea is what i was just talking about
sarcasm
you know i figured you would
oh yeah well i think that maybe your mom has something to offer
how is she by the way
that's cool
i was down at the beach last week and there were all these adorable little hermit crabs running around they were so cute that i scooped up a bunch and brought them home
they were my new pets
but then after a while i got tired of my new pets so i gobbled them up
tra la la
i gobbled them up
sry people for not updateing lately
i haven't updated in awhile mainly because my puter has been annoyingly slow i need to ask my 'rents to buy me a new one
neway not much is new with me i really need to go out more worried i might be in a rut
 big big hugs thank you
i sometimes make that mistake too
fatalism is when ah screw it
i'm sure if you were meant to know about fatalism you'd find out about it eventually in any case fatalism is the belief that future events are predetermined for the whole of time and are entirely unalterable
oh my god
it was fate i was destined to define fatalism as the belief that future events are predetermined for the whole of time and are entirely unalterable
oh my gosh is this my role in life am i to be forever defining fatalism
looks like nope
i feel about the same
luckily everything else in the universe has shrunk to the same scale
crazy
good pronoun use
well i guess i'll talk to you yesterday see you sooner
my comic has a slightly different ending
i have written the spookiest ghost story ever it is called the man who died and came back as a ghost
it's spooky it says so in the first sentence
it says it was spooky night with a ghost the ghost was the spookiest ghost in the world and he was so spooky that if you saw him you'd be scared for real
the um
the next paragraph is boo
sure i can
 the ghost explains that even if you were just reading about these events later you'd still be scared you realize with a chill that he is right
it is now it is if that's the format i have to use to tell my readers that they're scared
turn to page 32 to be spooked by the spooky ghost turn to page 14 if you'd rather see the same ghost and be terrified
i'm bill s preston
esquire
thanks to rufus' excellent time travelling telephone booth we can travel to any time period thus ted and i are gathering some ancient history dudes so that we don't fail on our most bogus history report
whoah historical babes
party on ted
be excellent to each other
time to visit all my wacky friends
oh hey dromiceiomimus my wackiest of wacky friends what are you up to some crazy scheme no doubt
ha ha that's wacky
utahraptor
you i think are surely my wackiest of friends what news
certainly but i warn you a school burning down
pretty wacky
huh god my friends aren't crazy crazy's insane my friends are wacky
wacky
probably not cause they're wacky
why lets get this crazy/wacky issue settled first
god fine
 okay
seven minutes have passed
you could have timed this yourself i guess this is kind of an unnecessary favor
no i don't
i'm going to write a great novel it will be about one man's struggle to make a life for himself in the modern world and it will be wonderful he will achieve all he desires and be at the peak of his career
and then in the last sentence a filing cabinet says you're fired and i can talk
hah hah best ending ever
didn't you hear the ending a talking filing cabinet you're fired and i can talk
hee hee
no
it recontextualizes the book people will be like i thought this book was transcendental until that last sentence when the talking filing cabinet showed up
nope it's just a talking filing cabinet that undermines the whole book
i will call the book an unexpected ending
are you there god it's me
you know not much
i was just wondering if you'd heard any good jokes lately
really you haven't heard one good joke
maybe even a joke that was just alright
oh i was just chatting up god to see if he had any good jokes but no dice
come to think of it yeah i bet he'd do something lame like making all of the universe the joke or something
alright everyone there's no need for any more haiku the art form has peaked
this is because i've just composed the perfect haiku it has intrigue a cold night and perhaps a hint of gunplay
truly the best haiku ever to japan
huh
oh i disagree as you are clearly wr ong and i am quite right
but what to do
 for a sequel
if there's one thing i know
 it's women
isn't that right dromiceiomimus wouldn't you agree that i have an uncanny understanding of the female gender
come now don't be shy
but why it's clearly true
nuh uh
i have faith in random developments of chance of a potentially divine nature from where do you hail
you attractive individual
i have faith in what may appear to be miraculous occurrences since you entered my immediate locale
you attractive individual
during the previous diurnal cycle i counted myself among the ranks of the lonely now you're lying in quite close proximity
engaging in intercourse
dear recipient of this comic
it isn't working out
maybe it's not you it's me maybe there were many small things that added up to this relationship not working
i don't know this card isn't very personalized
come to think of it i'd be pretty pissed if someone broke up with me like this
too true
i think whoever is being dumped here is better off without this person
dear recipient of this comic you're better off without this jerk
i would still like to hear about the sex however
i've gotten a new pet dog
hooray
my last pet dog ran away because i never fed him but this new dog i'm sure to feed every day
i know this now
it's also his description
i named him the angriest dog in the world
he's livid man he's tense bound so tightly with tension and anger he approaches the state of rigor mortis
good listener though
naked people
hot
dromiceiomimus what's your opinion on people who are naked
i would be forced to agree with you my good lady
hott
naked people
hot
dromiceiomimus what's your opinion on people who are naked
i would be forced to agree with you my good lady
hott
okay so we get a couple no a polyamorous crowd of people who all want to have a child but who are all infertile so then we get a donated fertilized egg
 and bring it to term with a surrogate mother who is herself married
then you give the child to the polyamorous crowd who have new members replace old ones quickly and quite often um infinitely often
that's i think how you get a child with the highest number of people who could possibly claim parentage tada
how's that
i haven't ruined any lives the kid has like bazillion parents think about his birthday
presents
if you ever find your consciousness your self sent back in time to a much younger you there are some changes to be expected remember
it can be frustrating to live out your life again
but there is hope small changes compound into large ones and soon you will be encountering situations that you don't recall
if you're going to impress by making predictions about the immediate future you should do so early on they may become increasingly inaccurate
quite so
this is why if you've gone back into your own life far enough using words and knowledge that are far beyond your means can help impress upon people the truth of your story
anyway
enjoy being 6
phew it was all a dream
the mission to find the treasure the car chase all a dream
my high school math teacher naked and smiling all a dream
that bizarre thing with the utahraptor that i don't want to talk about all a dream
it was nothing just a crazy dream
you must have had crazy dreams before
crazy sexual
i've said too much
so a friend of mine got a cell phone
i know
i'm of the belief that some businessmen who are never in the office could really use them but that most people don't really need one therefore they are allowed to be teased by me
ho ho they are allowed to be teased by me whenever they use their phone even if it's in an emergency
right
it was going to be really good though i was going to call really early i would have said do you like your cell phone now
 hello
huh
why not
you do
god again
he was just telling me that i shouldn't make fun of people with cell phones because he has a cell phone too
huh what does god need with a cell phone
friends
alright new novel done this one is a romance and is called
 pretzels in a lady's lap
it's named after a particularly striking scene from the book we're at a party and a young man accidentally spills pretzels as he walks by into the titular lady's lap she looks up eyes meet bosoms on both sides heave passions smoulder and perhaps romance blossoms
dude
i've always found them to be pretty sensual
really huh nobody else finds pretzels stimulating
well this has been quite the anagnorisis a moment of recognition or discovery
young parents
what's the deal
how come they want to have kids so quickly don't they want to live a hedonistic adult child lifestyle like mine for just a little longer
i don't understand marriage
huh
maybe but how come i don't want that i want all the cool things
also how come my bed is so cold and empty at night
time to go on a wacky adventure which would be quite amazing to an imaginary third pary with the ability to see my actions rendered as a continuous narrative
whew
 kick ass
well that was pretty much the best adventure ever do you recall when we got trapped in that mine that was filling up with water very quickly
yes it was quite amazing
thanks
it was unexpected but gratifying
so
what's left
i wonder did growing up in a small town influence my values
perhaps
though i think not as much as i would have liked it to sometimes i feel like i cling to my small town origins as a substitute for a real identity
yeah
you know a certain touch of naivet a wonder at the accoutrements subways etc of modern city living
ah those were the days
 i can never let my father whom i have a close relationship with know my shameful secret i never
 choke
 i never meant to kill my best friend
 it was my first time drinking and i thought that i was good to drive
 choke
 no
 yes
 i drank and drove tonight and i killed a man and last week i kinda date raped my date and i'm gay and i also am involved in a teen pregnancy
 oh dad
 and scene
i wonder what the future holds
hmm
whoo civilization's destroyed
whoah
that was like a grim dystopian vision
a vision of tomorrow
that's because i am troubled
i just tried imagining what the future will be like but what i saw was a world destroyed and i seemed excited about it
okay but if civilization is destroyed you and i will have words
angry words
i'm just sayin'
woohoo sex advice
our first letter comes from me
i write dear t rex i love your show i have a question sex huh what's the deal
wow thanks for your letter t
you answer your question i
may you what
hey it's my sex advice show get your own
awww cinnamon
so generalizations
i don't understand them
for instance after being bit by three tigers i'd start to generalize that maybe i shouldn't poke tigers because then they'll bite me but if i happened to meet three jerky citizens of a town the same process could make me conclude that everyone there is mean or worse what if i started generalizing across races i'd be a big ol' racist
yeah that's true
but i guess what bothers me is that it seems you determine whether or not a generalization is valid by evaluating its conclusion which in turn is based on your own prejudices
you mean the dinosaur factor of course
we're talking dinosaurs
down with money
we don't need it
we can just return to our utopia of old before money turned us all into greedy money obsessed quasi people right dromiceiomimus right money is an aberration that lessens us all we don't need it
and
i guess you could say your remarks are right on the money
ho ho five stars also i value our friendship
social skills are very important things to have
they are what allow us to get along with others and are the foundation of society
with the invention of the &#8220 internet&#8221 and &#8220 email&#8221 and &#8220 instant messaging software&#8221 people are more social than ever &#8211 and this increased chance for communication leads to better social skills hooray
doesn&#8217 t matter
smile and wave and back away&#8230
ah do i ever love the broad stereotypes of cultures
do i ever
they're like generalizations across races only socially acceptable
dromiceiomimus did you know that latin women are passionate and fiery
and british men are cultured and maybe a little stuffy
oh there isn't one
my people and i don't fit into your boxes man
heck yes i'm largely in favour of it
i say largely because i like to keep my options open anyway
passionate latin women
here i go here i go here i go again girls what's my weakness
men
ok then chillin' chillin' mindin' my business
yo salt i looked around and i couldn't believe this i swear i stared my niece my witness the brother had it goin' on with somethin' kinda uh
thanks mom
i had the strangest dream last night there was this disease going around that made people really violent i guess
anyway it affected these two women who i guess lived at my house
it was really creepy because these women would seem fine but then they'd just keep trying to get close to me no matter what i did they wanted to kill me
no i'm not it's just that dreams always sound really symbolic when they're described that's all
i don't
it was a dream i had just cause i dreamed it doesn't mean i believe it
what no it's not sexist in here
it's not me
when is something uncool enough to be cool again is there someone who decides one day that california raisins shirts are back in vogue
well i ju
whew what a fantastic nap
it seems i just had a snooze and didn't lose
ho ho did you hear that dromiceiomimus i had a snooze and didn't lose
because normally people say you snooze you lose but in my case i didn't lose anything
that's stupid and since when did we start personifying social sciences
my friend i am simply asking the questions that need to be asked
 new theory
 emotions are for the weak
 wouldn't you agree dromiceiomimus
 okay new theory bad emotions are for the weak
 fine
 new theory emotions
 i've said my goodbyes
indeedy now everything i say will be the truth
the path to enlightenment is truly through homemade drugs
go ahead dromiceiomimus ask me anything
twenty oh my gosh it works
no way dude
i'm afraid you'll ask me some personal questions of a sexual nature that i don't want to answer wait what the hell this was supposed to be a truth serum not a volunteer information serum
i've recently discovered the joys of sleeping naked by the way don't listen to me
i wrote some fan fiction last night
i know
perhaps there are many twists and turns and revelations in my exciting non canon tale dromiceiomimus
no show
it's actually surprise utahraptor and dromiceiomimus fan fiction
indeed i did good sir and may i just say smoochie smoochie hah hah
 you kiss in my story
powerful images for the passage of time
a clock's hands sweeping past 12
a sped up landscape scene with urban growth and decay happening in mere seconds
an old woman holding aged lace and gazing at a faded photograph of herself posing in her prettiest dress
ooh good one
i think my favorite was the old lady with the photograph of herself
that's true
i certainly don't know much about menopause though
nice i love you
creepy i love you so hard
adding hard after phrases that don't normally have hard after them can give an interesting effect i like it
hard
so
there's nothing wrong with appreciating the work of somebody else
ha ha what a silly thing to say
because that would be plagiarism and plagiarism is wrong
now to change the subject isn't today election day somewhere
politics huh
what is the meaning of life by this i mean how should i best live my life
more concretely what can i do now that is meaningful and justified and purposeful and justified and purposeful and not pointlessly absurd
i know dromiceiomimus i know but i'm sick of that being used as an excuse i am demanding big answers there must be some way to arrive at a solution
well i have an idea
okay so i don't know what the meaning of life is fine but i do know that others might so inductively the only thing i can do is try to make life easier for these other people until such a time that they figure it out and let me know
hah
what
allo bonjour
moi je suis un dinosaure
je suis un dinosaure extraordinaire je suis grand et vert
j'aime des choses et d'autres choses
ah oui
c'est quelque chose incroyable ca
ne me mange pas s'il vous plait
ah merci bien monsieur
j'aime toi et des choses et d'autres choses
i'm sick and ornery i just want to be left alone today so give me my distance
with this in mind i'm going for a walk
forget it dromiceiomimus i don't want to hear anyone's voice all up in my earhole
well yesterday i seemed to annoy my friends with my choice of the oddly obscene word earhole excuse me
sheesh i was just being myself
but there's a rude side to me too it's who i am
so you're implying that society serves a useful purpose by encouraging me to be nice polite
hey i hope you guys can hear me because i'm perfectly happy up here eaaaaarhooooole
okay
so you've got lots of countries right only you can dismiss about 90% of these since they don't really affect the agreed upon world scene
so then you've got this small collection of countries that make all the news world politics is how these countries relate to one another and internally to themselves
how so
man you're nerding up the place i don't need to hear this talk about applying adjectives
to make up for that i'm going to have to spend the rest of the day talking about women i've had the opportunity to kiss
it's much more interesting than world politics was anyway it's got women women in the mood to kiss
ah long forgotten childhood friends
i miss them sure we were probably a little petty and well kids but it feels like those friendships were somehow simpler more pure
i wonder what all my old friends are up to now i haven't seen most of them since grade five
you did
oh my goodness the little red scaled dinosaur how is she
oh wow did she mention me at all
i used to hide in the bushes outside her house
ah long forgotten childhood friends
i miss them sure we were probably a little petty and well kids but it feels like those friendships were somehow simpler more pure
i wonder what all my old friends are up to now i haven't seen most of them since grade five
you did
oh my goodness the little red scaled dinosaur how is she
oh wow did she mention me at all
i used to hide in the bushes outside her house
does betty put butter on the bread mean the same thing as betty buttered the bread
i would argue no
in the second example there is an implication that the bread is wholly buttered while in the first this is not necessarily the case and this applies not just to butter there are many other examples for instance gary wrote for many tv shows leaves open the possibility of a co author on the scripts a possibility that gary wrote many tv shows does not
yes
agreed
 whoo it's cool to be cool
 and i'm the coolest
 this guarantees me popularity who would not like to hang out with someone who's the coolest the answer is no one
 yep
 i'm experimenting with it they say that women like a man with confidence so i will be the most confident man ever
 sucks for them they won't get any of my sweet dinosaur kissing
 guess who kissed two ladies at the same time yesterday
 if you guessed t rex you are correct
 woo hoo that's stereotypical male fantasy number 1 checked off now i can move on to stereotypical male fantasy number 2 at my earliest convenience
 really
 i'm surprised you don't have any idea
 well yeah but it's the specific nature of the improbable actions that matters remember
 we had this discussion after i showed you my one day lots of people have sexy sex erotic fiction
time to fix all my relationship issues with my girlfriend kayleigh by going back in time
 using the power of my mind
shit
huh
oh well i can fix that
sheesh
darn it
this time
that's okay
 this too shall pass
hah hah hah
isn't that right dromiceiomimus wealth and power and knowledge and love and friendship are all fleeting and pointless whoo one day will we all be dead
that too shall pass
it applies to all things
man i'm not trying to get invited to any weddings
ouch
for me
today i am talking about the made up desease ryoma and there are many kinds of ryoma one can contract
festering ryoma for instance
eww
creeping ryoma
salacious ryoma
mephitic ocular ryoma
i know it's amazing
ryoma doesn't even exist and yet it's the most disgusting desease ever
 as we kissed i could taste the ryoma on her lips
the manliest thing in the world easy
wastin' food
oh man imagine a guy who orders a big steak dinner with all the fixings and then when it's delivered he just flips it onto the floor
that would be one tough dude i would rate him super manly
it just is
it captures the essence of masculinity doing stuff that we think is cool even though there's many a good reason not to do it
like friggin' draining a lake filling it with sloppy joes and then spraying the whole thing with pesticides
and piloting the crop duster personally i tell you wasting food the manliest thing in the world
that and punchin' stuff
i wonder are we actually making progress
 where we refers to the general population of course
well what about philosophy for instance we've had thousands of years to think about what it means to be alive yet we're still no closer to an answer where's the progress when we're still grappling with the same questions as the ancients
i do
self justification from philosophers who can't reach a conclusion my friend i want answers not debate i want a one sentence summary of life
yeah only catchier and more informative
and less depressing
i hope i never get buried alive
yep that sure would suck
boy would i ever hate to be buried alive i can't think of anything i'd dislike more i mean damn buried alive
like what
woah is that what i sound like oh my gosh i don't want to get buried alive at all
i thought stressing that fact would make it clear but apparently not i drop the subject now but don't forget no burying t rex alive
so i'm not really comfortable with the fact that my mind is actually something physical
it implies that everything i am everything i think can be altered
it's scary some people who suffer brain damage can have their entire personality rewritten heck add some chemcials and you can alter how and what a person thinks
that's crazy
crazy
it really does
you know what freaks me out the most though it's those remote control cyborg cockroaches they've made by pretty much taking over the animal's nervous system i can just imagine the insect screaming endlessly in it's mind as its own body is made alien
anyway that was sort of tangential getting back to the subject isn't it crazy that our minds are something physical
what a good mood i am in today
i declare high fives all around
hey dromiceiomimus give me a thigh five
what whoah i meant to say a high five of course
oh man what an embarrassing slip of the tongue i have to go now
what the heck a thigh five where did that even come from
oh hey utahraptor did you know that i just accidentally asked the dromiceiomimus to give me a thigh five
my friend thigh fives are a ridiculous way of expressing enthusiasm i am aware of this
this is not the issue here
i hope i don't run into the dromiceiomimus today she probably thinks i'm crazy since i asked for a thigh five the last time we met
oh shoot there she is time to go incognito
t rex who es t rex i am a different um tyrannosaurus rex
darn it
she remembers i'll never live this down
people laugh at typos in heaven
i've come to accept that i will be able to live down anything i do given enough time
so no worries
exactly i am a well adjusted dinosaur
sure what's up
of course social constraints serve a useful purpose
i remember from the trial
i just discovered that i can get digital prints for only 29 cents
did you know that you can now get digital prints for only 29 cents this will change the world
b b but 29 cent prints
hey there utahraptor have i ever told you that you're a prints among men
a 29 cents prints that is
still burnsauce
the craziest thing happened to me yesterday
it was the craziest
it was so crazy i don't feel comfortable talking about it
no thank you it was too crazy
my friend it was so crazy it was off the hook
i know
as i say it's analogous to leaving one's phone off the hook
hmm
yep it's certain i can find no downsides with being immortal
that's okay come on living forever i could do anything i could do everything twice
could that happen
but then where would i be getting my energy from
hmm i guess the idea of immortality does clash with the scientific principles of conservation of energy
and so once again i am forced to reject a fantasy because it is based on bad science
 science means that not all dreams can come true
you know those early photographs the silent gloomy sepia toned ones
they're so sad
what gets me every time is the faces of people i'll never meet people long dead trying not to move as they stare into that early camera lens but what especially always gets me are the faces of the people who did move this was for some the only time their face would be recorded and they happened to shift
that's so sad that's profoundly sad
kind of but i think what affects me the most if the idea of someone coming that close to achieving at least a type of immortality and then losing it to something as natural and ordinary as glancing away
it does indeed it makes me want to go home and sit alone and sober in a darkened room
whoooo
man i've always wanted to travel to the future
always
it would be so cool to see how things work out wouldn't you agree dromiceiomimus
also i'd take back future technology with me and claim it as my own invention
says you
a paradox
there's nothing funny about paradoxes
tonight i am going to bed early
sweetness
more sleep for me
hey dromiceiomimus what time are you going to bed tonight
cause i'm going to bed early tonight
me early
word has it right
what are you talking about it's cool to get a good night's sleep
what
it's cool to get a good night's sleep
hmm
 sigh
maybe i should just accept that i'll never be on the cover of a magazine
because it means you're famous
hey yeah i'll make my own magazine and it'll be my magazine for teens
hmm
 sigh
maybe i should just accept that i'll never be on the cover of a magazine
because it means you're famous
hey yeah i'll make my own magazine and it'll be my magazine for teens
i have conceded that literal immortality is impossible
however
i am comforted by the fact that a type of immortality may still be possible i speak of course of immortality through art
yes
and in doing so it will remain forever fixed for all future generations to see
that's a great idea
we'll live forever
imagine if santa claus worked at a newspaper
 ho ho hold the front page he'd say
hee hee
or if he worked on a boat ho ho hoist that mainsail lads
or if he worked as a chipmunk he'd say i'm going to ho ho hoard all these nuts
i bet he would
ho ho hold up
ahem my wit is christmas themed
you may be right however i still think my wit is stellar
come on tell me that if santa claus worked as a chipmunk he wouldn't talk about ho ho hoarding nuts
it's a calling i know answer the question
argh people on the internet
so dumb
i can't take it any more dromiceiomimus everyone is off posting their dumb theories based off incorrect facts and nobody even recognizes subtlety so many people are so lame
aaah that's not the point rage
argh
i have too much rage all these people are writing dumb things with incorrect spelling and grammar and when you correct them they just get angrier its really annoying
it was subtle irony sheesh everyone subtlety
also
noticing such things in spoken language is impossible
hooray for christmas
hooray
hooray for getting christmas cards
hooray for getting christmas cards with no return address signed with names you don't recognize
sure did skip
and that's one mystery i'd prefer to leave unsolved i'm really enjoying this feeling of mysterious popularity
who could it be who have i forgotten maybe it's a pretty lady who wants to kiss me sometime
oh man
hooray for potential christmas smooching my friend
time to do it up
quebec style
time to wrap up some presents for all my friends
quebec style
time to stomp on this house quebec style
it's new and exciting
i invented it because it sounds as i say exciting and full of promise let's go see a movie quebec style oh wow what does it mean what's so different i dont know but i'm excited to find out
hey guys i brought a nice salad quebec style
there's nothing wrong with that
it saves the environment by using less paper
replaced replaced with a healthy respect for the environment
plus it was cheaper
not really
like wrapping them in the plastic bags they came in
just like my memories
seeing all my old friends and family over the holidays has been fun good times
but it has also been sad
we've all changed it makes me more nostalgic for how things were before just a year or two ago not because things were better but because they were different i always feel like i missed some opportunity like i could have done something then that i can't do now
i know
but i feel like everyone all of us could have done so much then if only we handn't spent so many nights at home watching a movie or sitting in front of a computer
my life reduced to cliche
bah nostalgia
what use does it serve
all it does is make us want things that we can't have and can't even work towards having forget it it's wasted time
from now on i will not spend time remembering the past nor will i be sad when circumstances change from now on i'm all about tomorrow
and those who cannot remember to attribute their quotations are condemned to commit academic offences
nostalgia can make you sad
man you'll never find me on a mountaineering expedition or on a voyage to find the northwest passage no thanks
do people not realize what's bound to happen
as i see it you're pretty much asking to be put in a situation wherein the food runs out people betray one another frozen corpses of friends are found in the morning and eventually everyone resorts to cannibalism
well you won't fool me i know the stereotypes
says you
i can't help it if no cannibalism is less memorable than tons of cannibalism
wait or can i
oh no
it's a disaster
what i already stomped on it like 5 seconds ag
oh my goodness
hooray
that sounds just scientific enough to work
let my last words be an incentive against the words blog and blogosphere
i have lived as few men dared dream
oh no
it's a disaster
what i already stomped on it like 5 seconds ag
oh my goodness
hooray
that sounds just scientific enough to work
let my last words be an incentive against the words blog and blogosphere
i have lived as few men dared dream
oh no
it's a disaster
what i already stomped on it like 5 seconds ag
oh my goodness
hooray
that sounds just scientific enough to work
let my last words be an incentive against the words blog and blogosphere
i have lived as few men dared dream
man forget verbs
you heard me
from now on i am all about other less complex parts of speech verbs don't understand me
maybe adjectives wouldn't force us to have such conversations
true but we can awesome
and we can sexy

 we can sexy is totally going to be my epitaph
for reals
someone at my house finished off a bag of milk and then put it back in the fridge without replacing it with a new bag
that's so annoying
also it's very confusing since i live alone
what do you think dromiceiomimus am i going crazy am i finishing off the milk and then completely forgetting about it
what else could it be is someone breaking into my house just to drink my milk i don't really mind i guess i'd just like to know
it's not my fault
why would i screw myself over by not putting a new bag of milk back that's crazy
was it you
ssh come closer
i know secrets
secrets of the medical profession
what
huh
oh right well the secret is that when doctors and nurses are taking your pulse they're not actually doing that
really they're actually discreetly observing your breathing they do it on the sly because if you're aware of it it changes
hah hah i am an agent of chaos
oh man i ate too much last night
ooooh man
i had so much food dromiceiomimus i thought i'd be smart and cook enough food for lunch the next day but then i ate it all
ooooh man
dude i wasn't trying to impress her i was just relaying an amusing anecdote from my own recent history
yeah i ate a lot
ha ha
so i thought i'd cook enough for the next day as well
not yet but allow me to continue
i challenge myself to watch fifty two movies in fifty two days
some of them were pretty okay i guess
 sigh
good eye
i am a little it wasn't the point of my experiment but holy there are so many bad movies
it's true my friend have we become elitist snobs are we too good for anything
have we finally become too cool for school
man my source for medical secrets won't tell me anything now because i broke her confidence when i told everyone about the breathing thing
hah hah
oh well
i know tons of secrets about other professions anyway dromiceiomimus did you know that restaurants want you to fill up on bread
it is the essential paradox of the restaurateur
yes well that's over now
 the only other medical secret i know is that doctors may discreetly ask an elderly patient about his central vision by asking him if he has any trouble reading the numbers on his stove
whatever man
what to the ev to the e r
submit it to me youngster
and all the ladies proclaim that i'm quite adequate for a man of my racial denomination
you are aware of the difficulty entailed in simply managing one's life today
the one whom we're considering is not popular but he attempts to five off that air nonetheless
attention attention engage that neoteric device
i'm tired of movies and plays and radio dramas in which all the characters have such snappy dialogue
it's unrealistic
it really yanks me out of the moment how am i supposed to imagine myself being there when everyone talks like they know their lines
and also sometimes like they're part of a larger work with a distinct thematic focus forget that
yep
and um
sorry what were we talking about there i just remembered i have to mail a letter today
oh ho did i just do that on purpose am i really that clever
what's for dinner
the first law of thermodynamics
important
the second law of thermodynamics somewhat less important
if the laws were personified i'd feel sorry for the second law he'd be the affable loser dressed in his brothers second hand patchy tweed aww
well i'd invite him over for dinner we'd have chops
oh hey i'm glad you came by i was just imagining how nice i'd be to the somewhat less important law of thermodynamics if it were personified i'd have sympathy dinners
no worries
what who is this
leave me alone
so
i have my own refrigerator and you don't see me bragging
the devil he won't leave me alone and all he's doing is bragging about the video game consoles he owns
nobody cares
 ohhhhhhhhhhhh
 there's water in the basement and i don't know what to do
 if the basement keeps on flooding then i'll certainly be blue
 the water heater's leaking and my showers are all cold
 i wouldn't mind so much but it makes me feel so old
 boo
 thanks for your thoughts
so
time to discuss my lovemaking technique
okay how about my lovemaking strategy
i don't get it
i wasn't going to brag my lovemaking technique consists of a series of awkward fumbles and whispered apologies
i whisper apologies over and over while maintaining unbroken eye contact
hah just kidding
i guess this is how rumours get started huh
by mining the earth's outer liquid core i can sell precious iron thereby giving profits to myself and my business partners
profits
would you like to buy some precious iron featuring nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements dromiceiomimus
that's okay i'll keep mining it in case you change your mind
we'll all be dead soon
maybe this isn't the best business idea ever
featuring me
i have come up with the best science fiction story idea ever
it's about a man
a man who can only see well when a light is turned on
but this guy can only see anywhere when a particular light is turned on even when he's outside of the room with the light even when he's on the beach if the light switch is turned off so too are his eyes
huh there's no allegory just a twist at the end when we find out the whole thing was psychosomatic
that's part of the fiction
the science fiction
the fallacy of balance occurs when news agencies claim truth by reporting both sides of the story
in most cases that's not balanced at all
for instance if you're doing a story on how the sun is hot assuming it's a slow news day you don't spend half the story presenting a guy who thinks the sun is cold you ignore the crazy minority
but often when science is reported equal credence is given to the kooks and their kooky theories science is presented as merely an opposing viewpoint
i'm not
that's not me
there's degrees science is based on repeatable observation
dude i'm busy
such a nice day yes maybe a little brisk but that's okay
yes indeed it is a nice day to be sure
i think that's pretty clear but i guess i should answer her question i figure our innermost thoughts are kept privae too often so i've decided to shout mine to the world
hey why am i hungry i just ate a few hours ago i had a chicken sammich i think
i am having an inner dialogue
my friend it's clear that shouting is the best way to have inner dialogues i agree

leave me alone you crazy bastard
no
argh so inane
the devil
all he wants to do is talk about these stupid games i've never played he knows i've never played them and yet the chatter continues
i'd prefer that
never played it
so what's the deal with sisterhood
hah hah
am i right
no way i know all about sisterhood i know all about all sorts of things
well even if it was i could always get a sex change and a new family or something i don't know how nuanced can it be to be a member of a set of two mutually female siblings
do you ever wonder what the pillow fights are like
i no longer wish to die someday it's true i have decided that aging is for chumps
and as a non chump this means i must find a way to be immortal
this is true but i have found a loophole a loophole in science
sure i will simply freeze time itself
that way we all get to live forever without breaking any universal laws watch
i'm sure i have no idea what you're tal
there are a few moments in my life at which i can now see in hindsight critical events took place
these events set in motion other events which finally led to the person i am today
for instance dromiceiomimus had you and i never met i would never have become so good at scrabble
still things would be different
well
all i really wanted to point out was that it's cool to think about these things sometimes you know like chance jobs where you met friends or perhaps lovers things like that
oui oui tout le monde et ca n' arret pas
je veux une petite quelque chose quelque chose
here are some amusing observations about everyday life
1 men stereotypically leave the toilet seat up
2 parking spaces can be rare
3 airplane food
well that's it
explain
sheesh of course i would i make jokes about whomever i please
is whom a necessary english construction its role as object is already indicated by syntax
i discovered some bad news yesterday my bicycle needs a new seat
the shaft upon which the seat is mounted has become bent
i'm sorry it's just hard to talk about bicycles without sexualized language that's the nature of the beast
i also need a new pump for my tires
i really don't think i could
to summarize the thrust of what i'm saying is
 apparently unable to penetrate your skepticism
really
spring break
woooo
wooo
spring break
woooo
spring break wooo
the thought did cross my mind
my theory and teen movies would disagree with you my friend
spring break
woooooo
excellent
yes my friends spring will be coming soon
hooray
spring is my favourite season dromiceiomimus do you know why
it is my favourite season because it is so pretty
oops
no i wasn't lying
i just um
fuuuuck
today i believe in temporal presentism only the objects around me are real they exist in space but not in time
neither the past nor the future actually exists
each moment is unique and life is but series of moments connected by our memories we speak of events occurring in the past only as a matter of convenience
yep
aha my friend that's only because this present moment is predicated on past moments being as they were
it does explain why time travel isn't possible you can't visit a past or future that doesn't exist
th that's pretty much it
today is valentine's day
hah hah sucks to that
i believe it to be a manufactured holiday last year it brought me nothing but trouble so this year i am going out of my way to make sure that everyone knows they don't have to celebrate their love if they don't want to
perhaps
you'll thank me when you share my politics
hey god check this out
a horse walks into a bar and the bartender says why the long face
what it was awesome
horses have long faces
literal long faces
i bet you don't know much about good jokes anyway
oh hey utahraptor check this out a dog with a missing foot hobbles into a bar and drawls i'm looking for the man who shot my paw
because sometimes cowboys' parents got shot
i won't
motorcycle enthusiasts call cars cages
motorcycle enthusiasts enjoy souping up their rides almost as much as anime fans enjoy the classic battle angel alita graphic novels
wow
i know
but did you know that some motorcycle enthusiasts refer to long motorcycle rides as numb bumming
my friends i have written a new book
a book for children
my book is called happy dog the happy dog and it mixes the story of happy dog with important lessons i've chosen about life it also features adorable drawings of happy dogs amazing
i'd be pleased to give a reading
 happy dog the happy dog is the happiest dog on his street he loves to play in the grass everyone you know will one day be dead
 happy dog loves to play fetch with a young boy named timmy timmy is happy dog's best friend timmy is made out of meat your whole family is made out of meat
what's up
mm strawberry my favourite
having proper posture is very important
stop slouching
having proper posture enables me to stomp this house without injuring my delicate ladylike ankles
here i'll demonstrate again this time on a tiny human lady
no it's not you're just jealous
stand up straight
we we're not
oh nooooo
man i'm getting fed up with fighting these ninjas all the time
 really fed up
do i hell yeah maybe if i smash their log dojo and ninja mobile they'll leave me alone
you know it perhaps if i stomp their beautiful yet deadly leader 'black lotus' i can end it for good
me either
i don't know settle down maybe i always wanted to be a farmer
oh no mars bats
too much of my life has been spent on not being a magician it's time to change all that
for my first trick i will make an entire house disappear
abra cad
people of space i hear your plea
 avenge me t rex
he he knows
they all know
ah another beautiful day
 or is it
i'm attempting to build dramatic tension
oh but that's where you're wrong even as we speak listeners are inching closer to our conversation sweat beginning to form at their brows what is it they wonder good or bad each moment we delay their anticipation grows ever stronger
actually it's a bit brisk for my tastes
it's decided
change is good
if i change this cup recyclable material
my children's children would thank me
my root beer
change can be very bad
oh man there were a whole bunch of raccoons hanging around outside my house last night i was like
aaaaaahhhh
there's nothing funny about this they're damned freaky animals they're smart and cunning and they sit on the heads of dogs to drown them
they do
and their hands their little nimble probing hands
they're not cute they're freaky they know too much they open up jars and stuff
holy shit leave me alone
damned sinister raccoons are still hanging around outside my house and just when i thought things couldn't get more freaky their cephalopod friends showed up
i was like
 what aaaahhhhh
squid cuttlefish and other similarly baleful creatures are all members of the cephalopod family characterized by huge eys beaks intelligence and ambition
they played us for suckers
they're jet powered did you know that they're jet powered animals and their heads are covered in prehensile tentacles they're carnivorous and most are cannibals
i don't want any trouble cephalopods
so the good news is that the raccoons and cephalopods aren't hanging around my house anymore
the bad news is that they've moved in together next door
yeah quite a sinister development the two animals i find the freakiest develop the ability to talk and move in next door i do not need to know animals with these abilities
not really it's not racist to like some animals and not others besides i'm not irrationally against raccoons and cephalopods they've threatened me they wait menacingly outside my house for me to come home
cephalopod and raccoon neighbours i respect your unique worldview
time to educate my peers through the medium of incredibly true facts
hello dromiceiomimus did you know that if you held your eyes open when you sneezed the could pop out pop
it's true they could just pop out like crazy
true stories facts want to hear one
of course not ha ha so um here's a fun fact about trumpet players each saves the contents of their spit valve in a mason jar and chugs it at the end of the year
i don't know why
it's true
sometimes i get a little sad
you wouldn't guess it from my rugged exterior but beneath my tremendous frame beats the heart of a sensitive man so sensitive
yes well i realize that now utahraptor and it makes me very sad
i'm sad on the inside
seriously check it out
 boo hoo hoo let's have a lengthy discussion about feelings
wooo i'm talking the talk
 i've changed my mind you know what's great
 nostalgia
 hot wheels tm cars
 simpler videogames
 less swearing on the radio
 woooo
 bmx tm bikes
 i am
 nope
 ninja turtles
the devil
what's that matter run out of video games
huh
man i don't want to hear about it
he's the one talking to me i didn't ask for this
must be nice
i sent an email to some dude today and it came back with a verification message i had to reply to in order to prove i was legit
stupid whitelist spam protection systems
not these ones they're inherently flawed assuming you ever want to hear from someone you don't already know if two strangers have a whitelist system then either they can never talk to each other or they still get spam
of course
because if verification emails can get through then it won't be long until spammers send messages that look enough like them to also get through there's still a hole and if you seal it you miss real verification emails
i'm open i'm open i'm open
so life proceeds despite the fact that i've got the freakiest neighbors ever who wants to live next door to sinister raccoons and cephalopods
not me
the only advantage i can think of is that it'll be cool on hallowe'en that's it and that's not even much of an advantage actually not even
hah
man these animals are without fear i don't see how acting like i'm not afraid will help things
no way dudes nothing you can say will scare me
oh man i'm still a little tired from last night
time to go and get some hearty man sleep
damn straight dromiceiomimus i am recently all about adding man in front of things to make them sound all the more manly you should see me man snooze i man snooze with a pure man fury
possibly
but i definitely have no interest in finding out all i want to do today is have lots of man naps and stomp on things with my stern man foot
i know but i can't figure out a way to stop that
i live with my man failings
so what's the deal with
 post communism
it's what comes after communism i think basically what's the deal with it
i freely admit that i do not
but i ask assuming it exists what is its deal
please
really no state has ever claimed to have reached a fully communist system and so the term is inaccurate etymologically speaking that's pretty cool
would it not be pretty neat to average out your emotional states across your entire life
i bet i'd never be sad again
no way dromiceiomimus i bet that i would be on average at least kind of happy
sad
that would be pretty awful knowing that on the whole your life is one of sadness
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
hhuuh
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
here are some bad things to say to someone who just broke up with his long term girlfriend
 wasn't she the best ever
 i was always impressed with her wit her beauty her intelligence and her sense of humour
 it's too bad you never go married eh
 i had a bit of a crush on her too she was a cutie
 was she a good kisser
 do you remember kissing her
 pretty nice are you worried that one day you'll forget what it was like
 wouldn't that be sad
i concede that sometimes it's nice to be polite however
i also believe that it's not nice to be insincere i am in conflict
this is because there are situations in which being polite implies being insincere for example i may think someone looks pretty ridiculous in their fancy new hat but if they ask me what i think i'll try to say something positive about it in order not to hurt their feelings i am polite in sharing my opinion
huh
if everyone knows people are being insincere then what's the point of polliteness we end up in the same place semantically speaking
hold that thought
hey you across the street
i like your friggin' hat
today is a good day i think for more secrets of the medical profession
wooo secrets
dromiceiomimus you know how doctors will hit your knee with a hammer to test your reflexes
well in some cases the patient will be too aware of what's going on and the test won't work in such cases the patient is asked to lock their hands togetehr and pull them in opposite directions this distraction allows the test to succeed
i believe this is called the jendrassik maneuver
you're telling me what's neat about it though is that it's automatic even if you're aware that it's a distraction the maneuver still works
yep it's a neurological distraction affecting the pathways between the central nervous system and the motor neurons dishibiting any tonic i e baseline inhibitions doctors huh
today is an excellend day i think for walking aroudn like i own the place
woo looks like my day just got filled up
dromiceiomimus would you say that i'm an excellent dude for walking around like i own the place
i'll let history be the judge of that
what
okay so what if i said i think i'll let an assumed future history which agress with my current position be the judge of that
noooo
hey i have a great idea i'll get a webpage and then i'll put up all sorts of personal stuff about myself and my friends on it
then when it blows up in my face i'll um
anyway to the internet
hello my friend i'm fine
right
sweet
everybody dies
but we've still got some time
in order to make things easier for myself and my peers i am construction a personl enemies of t rex list enemies list
featuring corporations
first on my list are the people who make those cans of frozen concentrated juice at the grocery store when i open them they sometimes explode a little juice on me
i think it's because water expands when it's frozen and so the can is under pressure and there's a little melted juice at the top i don't know but they're on the list also 1970s american popular culture
why wouldn't i
dude you're coming close to questioning the very idea of an enemies list
man the coolest thing ever
skateboarding out of a friggin' crashing helicopter
the only way it could be better is if you yelled extreme on the way down whoah extreme
you know it and plus you could do extreme tricks on the way down like a backside lipslide 50 50 fakie

i hadn't even thought of that
that is pretty friggin' extreme
whoaaaaah
last night i started to write my own autobiography however i had to stop after a while because as it turns out my life is not that interesting
imagine my dismay at coming to such a realization
therefore i have resolved to make my life better copy and will from now on style my activities such that they'll be appealing to a hyopthetical audience
i will be forever on stage performing
oh yes
i imagine that is very true
god hey want to watch me go spice things up when i make naked sub sandwiches
 mary was a young girl 15 years old and desperately in love with her next door neighbour tom
 it was three years before the great war
 tom sat on his porch in the cooling night 'how do you do ' said mary curtseying slightly 'hullo mary ' said tom 'how are your folks ' he raised his voice so slightly that it was not a question but mary didn't notice she was wearing here prettiest dress the one with the blue floral print that her mother had sewn for her on her birthday mary smiled
i'm writing a story
it's a heartwarming story about two children growing up in a simpler time a time when gender roles were clear and children played hopscotch on their way home from school
hah hah just kidding
oh man did i get you did i get you
what if i said i'm not really kidding
i've been thinking about gender roles is gender a social construct
or does it refer specifically to the persuasion of one's naughty bits
this is true plus people's ideas of masculine and feminine change over time and across cultures i don't think either a purely social or biological explanation satisfies
indeed
hey let's try though
you the man my friend
hah hah how delightfully droll
i've been thinking about gender roles is gender a social construct
or does it refer specifically to the persuasion of one's naughty bits
this is true plus people's ideas of masculine and feminine change over time and across cultures i don't think either a purely social or biological explanation satisfies
indeed
hey let's try though
you the man my friend
hah hah how delightfully droll
alright alright things i need to do today
get dog food for my very angry dog
buy some food for me while i'm at it write a letter to my grandmother whom i love dearly laundry
i do
oh but the grandmother letter isn't a chore i like writing letters and especially letters to my grandmother
i know it
i am the worst grandson ever
the straw man fallacy isn't so much a fallacy as it is a way of life
in this fallacy you present an altered version of your opponent's argument in order to make it appear absurd you then tear apart this weaker ridiculous argument and claim victory basically it can be summarized as make stuff up and attribute it to your opponent haha excellent
maybe
but it's also a great way to win debates and if anyone calls you on it you just say come on your attack on me is the real straw man fallacy here let's be serious
hah hey how did you know i use the internet
the world revolves around me the world revolves around me
 probably
 around me
 pro
bab
ly
ohh the world revolves around me
yes the world revolves around me
 probably
yes the woooorld she revolves around me probably
sheesh okay it was just an amusing little ditty i wrote it myself you know
thanks god
light verb constructions lvcs are constructions like take a stroll and give a smile
they are formed by combining a light verb such as take and give with a complement stroll smile most of the meaning of a non idiomatic lvc comes from the complement stroll and smile
i know
yes this is true
sure would hmm i wonder if statistical measures of association would correlate well with human judgement of construction acceptability
hot crackers they do i should totally write this stuff down
bad news everyone
i'm not as skinny as i used to be
whatever dromiceiomimus you're fine but look at my thigh it's somewhat larger than before
whatever man i'm getting older and chubbier
oh are we gonna talk about cultural relativism cause i can talk about cultural relativism
people are always like boo hoo hoo i'm not motivated well not anymore not since i t rex have decided to become
 a motivational speaker
it'll be fantastic dromiceiomimus i will motivate through a combination of folk wisdom and uncommon sense advice couched in clever stock market analogies
sounds motivational
think positive friend
basics eh hmm
excuse me unmotivated people i'm t rex your motivational speaker
so has anyone here ever tried setting goals and then achieving those goals
so throughout time people have spent their youth learning and the time after that applying what they've learned not a bad system
 for a first try
the problem is that we're spending longer and longer studyin if you do a phd you could be 30 years old when you graduate and since there's so much to know about the world people are forced to specialize even at 30 there just isn't enough time to learn it all
it's true
but what if it didn't have to be that way if we lived forever we could learn so much we could make connections between completely unrelated fields
sure borrow my four seater rocket car whenever you want
hah hah i'm totally glad i invented it
so i went for a walk last night before bed simply because i wasn't tired yet and had nothing to do
true story
after walking for a bit i found myself in a 24 hour grocery store why i didn't need any groceries i guess i just found the bright lights and the prospect of buying snacks enticing
yes just some chips and a drink i didn't need either of them
yeah man
and shopping for food that i didn't even need no less i suspect that the symbolism of this at both a personal and societal level is pretty damning
exactly
man whatever these chips are overwhelmingly delicious
 man i don't
 i don't think about video games as much as you do okay you've got to understand this t rex equals doesn't want to talk about video games all that often

 i think i got rid of him
 the devil i told him off pretty harshly and i guess i hurt his feelings does that make me a bad person
 great let's talk about that instead
my sinister raccoon and cephalopod neighbours are having a sleep over party okay that's innocent enough i don't judge
but putting up fliers for it around town
that's creepy that's odd that's off who indiscriminately invites people to a slumber party
apparently
no way man
i've told you all the creepy things they've said to me i don't want to put myself in a situation where i'm unconscious and pyjama clad around them holy heck
i'm sorry i i think i'm busy that night
i have discovered the secret of being totally famous i will now share this secret
the secret is to be controversial
that way everyone is talking and thinking about you you become famous simpy from holding a contested opinion and the best part is yuo don't actually have to hold the opinion you just have to say you do it's so easy dromiceiomimus what are your thoughts on gay marriage and prohibition
a controversial ass though of fame
maybe they do
well that's it for me
so i was talking up my post pubescent body the other night and this guy was like post pubescent isn't a word because you can never get past puberty i was like whatever
it was some party
i maintain that you do you're pre pubescent then pubescent and then post pubescent when the changes stop
i disagree
fine let's look it up right now
fine i'll go do that
i'm gonna
dude come quick
there's pictures
it turns out that you can't escape politics in the media every song i hear every book i read and every movie i see has some political agenda even if it's just tacit support fo the dominant ideology
well i'm going to create the first politics free film
that's a start it'll document the world around me to ensure that my own beliefs can't enter the frame
oooh and it'll be in one long take so that i can't be accused of using editing to privilege some images over others it's going to be great great and apolitical
it'll work don't be such a downer
 hmm that that's true
the eye doctor had told me i might need glasses
me glasses
man glasses are gonna cramp my style i'm not a glasses dude i'm a non glasses dude
perhaps but still my style will be totally cramped
plenty
sleeping face down style rubbing my eyelids with the palms of my hand style glasses would interfere with both these activities
shit
global warming
what is the deal with second base nobody actually knows what it represents
 second base in the sexually euphemistic sense of course
i find these bases to be highly improbably dromiceiomimus
why
it's cute that these tough guys have no idea what's going on
but wimpy guys talk about women too
hah hah like computers
i was talking to a friend the other day and it turns out he'd never played the classic duck hunt video game
the devil what are you doing here
i can't believe it i've played a game you haven't
i am
get this he's never played duck hunt
seriously
you shoot little ducks on the tv with your gun
i saw a bumper sticker yesterday that compelled me to commit random acts of kindness
 true story
anyway that's exactly what i intend to do today kindness ahoy
is this house bothering you dromiceiomimus
well just in case
hey is this woman bothering you utahraptor
you're right
hah the next thing you know i'll have a wacky but non threatening gay frien
oh my god
 i know one thing that puts us living people made out of meat above machine intelligences
 that thing is the ability to feel physical pleasure
 for instance i'd like to see a machine intelligence feel the relief of a cool breeze on a hot summer's night they can't because they're machines
 we are the much more sensual people
 people > machines
 well i
 but come on you have to admit that we're the superi
that's me
many people wish to know how live a meaningful life
these people include newborn babies youth mature young adults disenchanted middle agers executives heck even your own next door neighbour may be secretely interested in living a meaningful life
some say dedicating your life to helping others is the key
however these people are wrong the only way to truly live a meaningful life is to engage in sexual congress with a large number of partners
hah hah okay you got me i was just fooling good one though eh
seriously helping others is alright
you mean you don't know you're god
okay
well as i understand it wind is caused when high temperature clouds interact with low temperature clouds and the earth's rotation works into is somehow
oh no
aw man why people always got to ram their cars into my house
did you have anything to do with this
i have a question that i can ask all my friends the question is would you rather kiss a music student or a psychology student
hee hee i am the best friend to have ever
dromiceiomimus listen i have a question for you would you rather kiss a music student or a psychology student
how interesting
the deal
what no of course not
you can't apply broad generalizations to heterogeneous groups each person has their unique properties and outlook on life
dude good thing i was around eh
i have made another exciting music themed discovery
any song can have its lyrics replaced with variations on the word chimichangas
for example chim chimi chang chim chimi chang chimichangas
come on everyone knows it
you wound me
it works really well with songs from mary poppins
what a delightful film
 let us talk today about a very important topic
 anger management
 one must always manage their anger lest it become under or even un managed and therefore out of control but we should also remember that emotions aren't good or bad things it's what we do with them that matters for instance anger can help us break things that would otherwise remain unbroken like with
 pi atas
 i'm glad you asked
 whenever you feel angry and think maybe you shouldn't be upset just repeat to yourself don't be so angry okay sheesh
 one might expect me to become hilariously angry at such a comment but i'm managing my anger
 still ouch
man i'm amazing i'm a machine that turns food into ideas
i'm a machine that turns chicken wings into things being stomped on i turn a who friggen' bag of chips into new ideas about gender relations what other new creation besides the dinosaurs of course can turn physical things into abstract ideas i'm totally great
shoot i am
though they never advanced beyond the prototype stage his engines were some of the first machines that transformed physical labour turning a crank into mental labour summing two numbers it was a revolutionary idea
and yet bag of chips gender relations
i could probably turn all you can eat ribs into a freakin' aria
today is a good day i think for talking about ex girlfriends
woooooooo
but maybe it is what could possibly go wrong
no no come on it'll be great
the worst
but what if i have only good things to say about them hmm what about that
i still love all my ex girlfriends and remain good friends with them to this day
t rex wins
time to talk about everyone's favourite topic
relationships
have you ever found yourself in a relationship that required at least a few sentences to explain what was going on that couldn't be summed up in a single word like boyfriend or ex girlfriend
exactly i'm glad you understand dromiceiomimus
um
they're pretty okay
okay honestly i wanted to talk more about how deep and important some friendships can be but we've somehow moved away from that
i have no one to blame but myself
so dating ex girlfriends i've heard this can be a bad idea but i don't know
what's the worst that could happen
maybe but i don't think so we're different more mature people now and if we make sure it's more casual less high expectations less intense i really think it could work
no
i've really tried to separate sex from it i don't know i'd just like to try it again hanging out doing things together having fun only now with a non zero chance of smooches
i really do
hah hah hah
how agreeable
anyway relationships are for the young and the criminally insane what's of real importance is that i saw a car dealership ad yesterday advertising that no reasonable offer will be refused
well yeah
oooh ads like that burn my biscuits of course they're not going to refuse a reasonable offer that's what makes it so reasonable and worse since reasonable can be a very subjective word it's not really saying anything beyond hey i won't refuse an offer for reasons that i personally find irrational
it's a thought fueled by rage
it just bothers me that they're trying to make it sounds like a big thing when it's just business as usual that's deceptive
so annoying plus i saw this other ad on the same day that said everyone approved o a c
o a c stands for on approved credit everyone's approved if they're approved aaargh
i could make some joke about tautological advertisements but i find them too annoying to laugh at right now
self doubt
while it can occasionally help us re evaluate bad ideas it can also be crippling people who are too self doubting can become figuratively
hah of course not
besides if i was it would be self skepticism not self doubt doubt can be irrational and unfounded but skepticism relies on a critical evaluation of the facts at hand and an informed judgment of their merit
no but i don't have any doubt in myself see
t rex rules the schools
i cannot stress this enough
unlike some people i like it when i have a dumb song stuck in my head
dayyyy o
me say dayyy o
daylight come and me wan' go home
come mr tally man tally me banana
day me say day me say day me say dayyyyyy o
w okay okay sheesh now i'm in a bad mood thanks to you satisfied
 dayyyyyyy o
aww look at the big baby baby wants his bottle
josh whedon or whatever he's calling himself this week totally just downloads fan fiction and says eh good enough that's why willow and tara are lesbians
you don't know that
you don't know that
yes well utahraptor
my friend died
aww
come 'ere you
where does knowledge come from does it derive from our obsercations of the world or could it possibly be innate
let's settle this question once and for all
i mean that all knowledge can be derived just by thinking about it that it can be deduced from just a few axioms that we all start out with such as a knowledge of self and an understanding of causality
not even
well perhaps it is
oh ho i'm sorry is it bitchy in here
i mean witty
are you having trouble programming your computer
let me give you a few pointers
it was an indirect reference
don't worry they're the least significant bit of my speech oh ho
they are
they allow one to reference the address of data instead of the data itself it's like how knowing someone's phone number lets you get in touch with them personally hence the delightful indirect reference pun
everyone program harder
let us discus public spaces such as parks and sidewalks does nobody own them or are they in fact owned by everybody
an interesting distinction if i do say so myself
if nobody is seen as owning a public space then nobody is motivated to care for it and so care falls to the government spaces become bland and inoffensive due to the nature of governance however if everyone owns them then everyone can take care of them and they can become vibrant and challenging
challenging artistically
people could put up posters and stuff on telephone poles along with ads and anything that anyone didn't like they could take down it would be an anarchic art show or something
i'll show you
argh friggin' yoga schools
this is not the first time in my life i've had incident to shout this
we can only imagine what it must have been like
the conversation
 during that time period in one place were gathered the t rex utahraptor and dromiceiomimus together in one location the greatest minds of our time
 i recall we talked about t rex a lot utahraptor once famously remarked
i'm working on a group biography about us but get this i'm going to bury it when it's finished so when it's discovered it will be published for sure it'll be historical
history does not record unfortunately what must have been a stellar retort on the part of t rex of this however we can be certain he was an awesome dude one is advised to tell one's friends
many people believe woman is a sexist term due to its apparent base in the word man this has led to crazy alternative spellings like womyn and even wimmen
however this is not the case
the word originally derives from the old english wifmann where wif meant female and mann meant a person of either sex thus a female human
nope it derives from the latin humanus earthling from humus earth soil
exactly
we can still see this today in words like werewolf which means literally a manwolf
according to me yes
this is why i spell the word wheirwolf and why i ask that you do the same you wouldn't want to be sexist would you
you'd also be respecting my unique worldview
have you ever noticed that summer is when pretty girls come out
i suspect that you have because it's totally true
i also suspect that i'm not supposed to notice but wow there are pretty girls everywhere they're just walking around chatting with their friends being attractive i like to look at them they're so pretty
how so
hah hah i would be like hello
i'd lick my lips while i said hello
here is a list of things to do while waiting in an airport
fall asleep wonder how your life brought you here stare at clock stare at own fingers maybe stare at fingers of others
tha
that's pretty much it
i can't think of any right now
or talking for that matter
in other news being cognizant is so totally sweet
expiry dates on food and juice products
whatever
counterpoint i drank some recently expired juice yesterday and it was exceedingly delicious the only reason people have such faith in expiry dates if because of the star trek tv shows
whenever there's a problem their computer is always all 15 seconds until fatal radiation exposure as though if you get 14 you're fine and if you get 16 you're dead for sure expiry dates like those on st tng are false and needlessly strict
it's different when you do it sheesh
also what
today is a good day i think to talk about pretension
pretension ah pretension
where would we be without pretension we'd be short a few critical essays on leonard cohen that's for sure
nothing of course
alas it's true
i'd like to set up some authority for pretension but that itself would be pretentious
heck i've got the time
i'm unemployable
 people who cut me off on the road are usually taxi drivers the two acidents i've had have both been hit and runs where i'm the one hit and they've both been with taxis
 i think i'm becoming racist against taxi drivers
 nevertheless it's the same emotion the same irrational distaste i don't know what else to call it i'm prejudiced it's terrible
 of course i would
 i jsut wouldn't like it if they showed up in my living room in their cab that's all
 in other news i'm now also racist against that phrase
there's a lot i don't know about being a professional chef there's a lot i don't know about a lot of things
does it have to work
nothing oh man i wouldn't even know where to start
i know they conduct semi well
oh it's true i'll probably never know everything about everything at this rate time to fall back to plan b
looks like i'm still the world authority on myself everyone go ahead
ask me anything
oh man let's talk about zombies they're the coolest by far
philosophical zombies that is
while that would likely be more fun to talk about i am instead referring to the idea of a person who acts externally like a real sentient person but who actuall lacks consciousness a mental zombie a philosophical zombie
sure do but inside they are dead
you must admit that it makes the whole debate a lot more interesting
well they probably could if they wanted
we all probably could if we wanted
you know
i'm instantly convinced that i could
how hard can it be to chew and swallow 12 desiccated dry and salty crackers in under a minute
come on i've heard that before
absolutely
i'm so convinced in my own abilities that i'll bet you five dollars that i'll pull this one off
my body has failed me for the first time ever
also i'm not sure how i feel about competitive eating
man if i were sent back in time 200 years i could easily make myself into a serious king by inventing things two hundred years too early
easily
i couldn't invent penicillin because i don't know what mold is used but i could do stuff with electricity like magnetically levitated trains oooh and electric fly swatters
with our powers combined we'd be unstoppable
why not
dude
 we could also invent women's rights and then totally take all the credit for it
hot enough for you
is it adjective enough for you
oooh and that one in which after stumbling one is advised to have a nice trip and offered hope of a reunion come autumn
aggravating thanks
also these martinis are more like martinies
ho ho
 i actually really like that one
man it sure has been a long december maybe this year will be better than the last
the days sure do go by so fast
hey dromiceiomimus do you think that i could be forgiven i wish you would
i is that a light attaching to you
anyway i guess it's just one more day up in the canyons for me
what dude it's been so long since i've seen the ocean
it's a song
holy shit what are the odds
 i think i'll go visit some places overseas why not i could plan a trip to the island nation of australia
 the worst that could happen is adventures
 not to mention the many stunning parks of natural beauty populated by unique rare and tasty animals
 i know
 seriously wow i guess you're right huh huh well that really puts my travel plans in perspective
i think that there's no animal more symbolic than birds they're so sad
 yeah that's true but whenever birds settle in an environment where there are no predators the first thing they lose is their ability to fly it seems the evolutionary purpose of flight is simply to avoid being eaten
the idea of birds forgetting how to fly yeah that's sad
and man imagine a pure white bird a father of two baby chicks lying dead and motionless on the sidewalk killed because it flew into an office window that's super sad
go on imagine it as hard as you can
there are some people who identify not as gay or straight or bisexual or what have you but rather as asexual i find this really interesting
it must be so different
some don't find themselves sexually attracted to anyone while others do but find all they want in friendship and have no desire to add kissing to the mix
i do because it's so far removed from my own experience i'm all about adding kissing to the mix it's what i do best
nope
well it's a fine line i'm not asexual myself so there's a distance between myself and the material but i am trying
i feel fine focused
heck i probably wasn't going to kiss anyone this month anyway
it's not often you can see how language is evolving but you can totally see it today with make and female nouns
it's the coolest
some pairs like prince and princess' are complete accepted while others like teacher and teacheress seem insanely sexist and out of date it depends on the word
i know but maybe one day people will think that about princesses or maybe they'll wonder how we got by without the word astronautrix
the coolest of all these words though are clearly those on the threshold of acceptability
oh actress and stewardess i guess words which some people will use without hesistation but which others will call sexist there's no consensus
looks like you've come down on the side of gendered professional nouns have their occasional uses
t that's cool man
are we still friends
i find age of consent laws pretty interesting because for something so basic they sure vary a lot from place to place again they're something for which there is no consensus is that a pun consensus that wasn't meant to be a pun
 anyway
most people agree that a 26 year old should be able to consent to sex while a child should be protected from sexual predators but where we legally draw that line is contentious some places allow 12 year olds to consent to sex while others believe that even people in their early twenties are unable to give knowledgeable consent to the intercourse
dangerous how
what i haven't mentioned anything that would make people say that i'm talking about legal ages of consent
though why would i be talking about this if i wasn't a pedophile ah yes
well played my friend well played
in the divine comedy this thirteenth century dude dante describes all these circles of hell where the wicked spend eternity for being so wicked
pretty heady stuff
anyway what's remarkable is that dante puts both homosexuals and money lenders in the same circle he thought both were unnatural interest makes something money from nothing no action on the lender's part while homosexuals make nothing hot gay action doesn't count from something their reproductive organs
it's in the book
well maybe he wrote in his diary that he did agree and i've read his diary
dude you're not allowed to lie to your own diary
a are you
my stars i have been so busy lately and it continues up to friday is going to be krazy for me
notice the 'k'
the 'k' indicates extra kraziness dromiceiomimus
i value our friendship dromiceiomimus
well that was an unusual interaction
i'm not sure i can i'd have to explain a lot about us in order for me to articulate why it seemed so unusual i'm guessing she was just upset with something else and wasn't in the mood for any of my shenanigans
dromiceiomimus are you upset with me and if so why
dromiceiomimus can we shout for a bit
it's been warm and then hot and then uncomfortably hot and then warm again which suggests to me that
summer has arrived woooo
dromiceiomimus horray for summer would you like to come with me and utahraptor to the cottage this weekend
woohoo this promises to be the best weekend ever in the hisotry of time
aw my pleasure
hey i got my pictures developed by the way
you'll notice that one of my nipples is highlighted in several of the pictures
just fyi
i think sometimes that i am not a very good friend because i don't have a very good idea of what is appropriate
i know i am full of surprises
but it's true i have trouble remembering the names of friends and tell jokes when i should be empathetic and understanding i'm just trying to cheer them up but usually they want sympathy instead of rough chuckles
but i'm not perfect either hmm
yes that will be my new goal i will become the perfect friend
aha i know you're only trying to point out the limitations of my plan but it's to be the perfect friend not the perfect pushover
for instance rather than taking out your garbage i'll hang out with you and we can talk about entertainment franchises we have a shared interest in do you like the recent star trek series
hah me neither
time to talk more about my made up country of canada
in canada you get real winters and real summers and there's places where you can get winter all year round if that's your sort of thing
that is heck no not my sort of thing but i'm glad to know it's an option
also in canada two chicks can totally get married
finally there is social liberalism and national pride but not one that is predicated on making other countries seem worse
it it does well heck
i fucked up canada
i had the coolest dream last night batman was in it and zombies
it was entirely great
okay so gotham city is infected with zombies right
people start getting bit dying then getting up and feasting on the flesh of the living batman and robin are fighting them off as best they can and while they're too fast and acrobatic to be touched there's too many zombies to kill them all they start rescuing as many people as they can taking them to the batcave for safekeeping it's a good place because it's not only big but protected and hidden
well soon the batcave is getting pretty full
and at some point they've rescued this guy who's been bitten but who's hidden it he dies and the next time batman and robin come back to the cave they find that everyone inside is now a zombie their effort has been entirely futile and everyone they've rescued is dead
batman flips out
and i wake up the end
 today is a good day i think to talk about phlogiston
 that's right phlogiston bitches
 phlogiston was proposed as a scientific explanation for combustion it was clear that some things burned like wood while other things would not burn like ash phlogiston was a colorless odourless and weightless substance that was contained in things that could burn when they burned the phlogiston was released into the air
 yeah but it totally worked for a while
 it explained why if you burned things in a jar they would go out the air can only hold so much phlogiston but it started to fall apart when people discovered that some things like magnesium actually gained mass when burned
 yeah that seemed a little too krazy but its actually pretty close to what we now believe only backwards
 we believe materials are deoxygenated and become oxygenated when burning
copyright is intended to prevent others from ripping off your creations it used to extend 28 years after you created something giving you a chance to profit while ensuring good ideas would eventually enter the public domain
however lately it's gotten pretty ridiculous
copyright extensions have pushed this protection up to the length of your life plus 70 years and beyond basically whenever micky mouse is due to enter the public domain copyright law is extended it's unfair and it restricts creativity
well
with these insanely long copyright laws there is no new public domain and our modern culture is owned and put in private hands it ensures you can't build on anything that's been created in the past 70 years
i just think we're approaching a state of perpetual copyright and that this could interfere with my bhangra remixes of pop songs
i mean my non bhangra remixes of course
they're good
oh man i'm gonna work the phrase little lower little slower into every conversation i have today
hee hee it's a good day to be t rex
so i was at the dentist today and he was all cleaning my teeth and i was like little lower little slower
he cleaned my bottom teeth
little lower little slower
wait shoot too soon can we start over and you give me a hug or something
incidentally that would be a good phrase to say to an ex girlfriend you're trying to hook up with the start over one i mean um
where'd everybody go
wouldn't it be pretty okay to travel at speeds faster than that of light itself
i submit that it would be pretty okay indeed
with that in mind i'm going to design an engine that can make something go faster than light
our current understanding will have to be updated pending my success
sure it'll be fun
or perhaps we're not trying hard enough let's work extra hard for a bit
then sandwiches
imagine if i snuck up behind some guy and put a kick me sign on his back only instead of kick me it said kiss me hah hah
that is one dude who's going to get all the sweet makeouts
and he would have no idea why suddenly all these people are making out with him from behind
hee hee it's the ultimate prank i'm gonna do it should i do it i'm gonna do it
but on the other hand putting a kiss me sign on someone's back would be extremely crazy
hah you think i should do it
let's ask past t rex what he thinks
do it dude
there sure is a lot i don't know about
clinical depression
i'm not i'm just saying that there's a lot i don't know about it how do you deal with it how do you best support a friend who is dealing with it i have no idea
i agree i am a model for us all
so depression
aw boo researching things much like the mental illness of depression is for chumps
oh man i should not have said that depression is for chumps that's like the worst thing you can say to a depressed person
sheesh t rex
okay so hypothetical situation let's say you've got two friends who used to totally date each other but now they're broken up and neither wants to see the other anymore
oops
the problem this raises for you as a friend is who do you invite to parties and such do you alternate invitations between events invite both friends and assume either they'll work out amongst themselves who's going or you'll get to see some sparks fly
it's true
but what if they want you to do conflicting things
i like to be prepared
there's this crazy rash i've got on my wrist this is an unwelcome development that i did not invite
forget you crazy rash
i am a firm believer in the do nothing and your problems will take care of themselves school of problem solving
all the time
like this one time i had to pay my phone bill but it's sort of a pain to mail stuff you know so i just waited and waited and eventually a collections agency called me and they let me pay my bill over the phone
it was amazing
attention medical professionals
why don't you call
has anyone ever heard of a book series called oh i don't know harry potter
dude because i totally have
and did you know dromiceiomimus that in the most recent book harry's friend ron weasley ends up asphyxiated on the moon
yes the moon there's no air up there so it makes sense that he ends up asphyxiated
no way jose
did you know that during a quiddich match it turns out that one of harry's teachers is a vampire
and who could forget the twist ending revealed in the last sentence of the book actually everyone in this story is a vampire
have you read it
it's so hot out today so hot
so hot
to escape the heat
yes i've always wanted to do that for some reason i've always wanted to be one of those people who does that
aww sorry i just saw one
dromiceiomimus and i went to escape the heat
ridiculous the movie needed way more explosions
saying the movie needed more explosions is my polite way to suggest that the film was a romantic comedy by the way
i find that most movies need way more explosions though
you know
i totally went out to fancy dinner with friends last night it was a lot of fun and the food was extremely delicious
i also left a big tip so as not to appear niggardly
eh would you say you find something comment worthy in my speech dromiceiomimus
aw man maybe maybe pretend you don't
it's true it's true
but my plan was to educate when people called me on niggardly i was going to explain how it most likely derives from the scandinavian nig miserly and in fact pre dates any similar racially charged words by hundreds of years
hey there how's everyone doing say that river sure is getting high huh maybe someone should put a dyke up around it
eh eh
homophobia
what a beautiful summer's day a good day for me to party down and shout wooooooo i think
wait i can do better
 ahem
woooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 indoor voice we're outside dromiceiomimus anyway if we were indoors right now i'm pretty sure i'd be just as loud and proud as ever
in that order
man context is for suckers and with that revelation i don't see how the term indoor voice on its own can mean anything at all
that's right i'm questioning the very idea of an indoor voice the revolution begins here
the revolution has ended due to lack of interest
so how do people do it how do people choose a direction in their life i mean
it seems pretty hard
yeah but what if you finally get that job and it's not all you hoped what if it sort of sucks
yeah but man
being unemployed was sort of the dream but now i realize that it just leaves me with a lot of free time and i feel useless and unaccomplished at the end of the day
but being unemployed isn't sucky all the time just some of the time i don't know i'm pooched man i'm pooched
being pooched is akin to being screwed
now you know
so sometimes i have these little secrets yes
yes
and sometimes these little secrets accidentally become big secrets because i never told the people i should have about them and it's too late now
i'm not thinking of any in particular actually just the general case
but i don't
they're just you know how when you've forgotten somebody's name and it's way too late to ask them now it's like that with these little secrets you know what i mean
am i the only one with these problems
because if so then i guess i get to work on my life management skills
d do people still talk about life management skills
okay so i've made a few runs at it and have never actually been able to travel back in time this i concede easily i totally dropped the time ball
but baby i've got a good feeling about today
my own life doesn't count and besides i could go back in time and change things like your breakfast today wasn't it delicious don't you wish you could have had that breakfast yesterday
mmm
i would not
besides it's not your timeline it's everyone's timeline we have to share it
fine fine i'll take everyone back in time with me why not how hard would it be to take everyone back in time
it was actually not that hard
aw shoot
did that fix time i don't think that fixed time
well i guess our only hope is to focus all of our willpower on changing things back to normal
i believe that maybe it could it's not like we have too many options let's do it
i feel the same
broken timeflows are crazy i'm sorry maybe we can fix it with wishes
i don't think that fixed anything man things are as messed up as ever
also my head hurts and i feel like making puns involving the word watch
wow it's great to be back in a timeframe that isn t beyond recognition is this the last time i will ever have incident to say that sentence
here's hoping
how are you feeling dromiceiomimus
i don't know probably i'm just lucky
about time travel and space
dude i simply employed lots of ingenuity and cleverness so much
the real question is why's everyone getting all up in my fries is there something particularly more attractive about my fries today
discuss
today is a good day i think to talk about hinduism
in hinduism there are many gods and aspects of gods and many of these divinities are sexual it's true some even have sex in the woods with regular mortals just for the fun of it in conclusion hinduism is a famous religion plus sexual congress
what
i do that with all major world religions though for example christianity
mary magdalene
eh
some religious scholars believe she and the historical jesus were more than just friends
ah the great library of alexandria a repository of learning founded in the 3rd century bc this library has become a powerful symbol for knowledge
especially since it was destroyed by fire or maybe looting a few centuries later
oh what knowledge we have lost what revelations were written on those ancient papyrus scrolls now entirely beyond our grasp with this lost information could the industrial revolution have arrived a thousand years earlier the only answer i can offer is an enthusiastic perhaps followed by a wide eyed who knows
it was a pretty great library
you're saying that by building up the legend i do a disservice to the actual libraries well i've got news for you my friend
um
the news is you make some convincing arguments
ah to be a child again to have no responsibilities to have a high metabolism that allows me to eat whatever i want
to chase after birds in the park wearing nothing but a grin
well after being small and irresponsibly eating a lot yeah
it's not that weird is it
hah i deny all these scurrilous allegations
there's no shame in that i do everything naked
science is based upon hypotheses conclusions and theories formed via repeated observations and experiments
this allows us to fashion an empirical and verifiable understanding of the world around us theories are said to be correct if they match up with the observed properties of the universe however science makes the tacit assumption that the universe is predictable and orderly and regular which may not be the case
i ask the question what if some of the theories and laws of science were merely statistical
well we say the speed of light is about 300 000 km/s because it's been that every time we've measured it but what if there's a small chance that sometimes the speed of light can just change
yeah man in such a universe science totally fails
dead wrong
about science
 you know what would answer the very important question of who is the manliest
 none other than a manliness contest heck yes
 dromiceiomimus i'm so manly that i crack open walnuts for old ladies with my pectoral muscles
 we both understand we're using manliness as an archetype and that your claims to manliness do not reflect upon your ideas of femininity or of normative gender in any case
 i'm so manly that i pound nails into the wall with my bare hands
 oh yeah well i'm so manly that i do that too while impregnating my girlfriend
 pretty manly
 and pretty consequential
what do you call fifteen profession members buried up to their necks in sand
not enough sand
why
hah ouch for profession members and their stereotype
we are
why
hah hah oh those profession members
they're not like us
i'm not hotted out by women who continue to wear high heels while getting increasingly naked
i'm just not
i have a theory about conventional western civilization being infatuated with a cartoonish idea of femininity
well you look at the women shown as being attractive in the media and what do you see an exaggerated female stereotype with all of the womanly characteristics underlined and highlighted
it's as if guys are so afraid of being called gay they go for the most capital w woman they can find
i don't think so man i think it's a side effect of homophobia in the media
okay how about with womanly characteristics
isn't that an odd and frankly creepy way to describe something i'm really interested in your womanly characteristics darling
 what are they like
 what are they like
ah solipsism the belief that only one's self exists everything and everyone else are just a projection of my imagination i made them up who invented all the arts and sciences
why apparently it's me t rex
probably i just want to make things more interesting
that makes me sound pretty messed up but yeah i guess
i can't make you dance that's true
dude i gain the knowledge that if i die the rest of the universe dies with me woo hoo
 this makes me super important
utilitarianism is an ethical system in which you always act to minimize pain and increase happiness this is the perfect system for me as i am all about increasing happiness
dromiceiomimus i am crushing this house because holy what if the people inside are really sad about something by smushing them i increase net happiness on the planet over the long term because they won't be sad anymore also stomping makes me happy net happiness increased
we could debate it but that might make me very sad
i must
i like this phrase pleasure calculus
is it truly as erotic as advertised
hooray
oh man do i ever love parties and parties held at this particular house are always the best ever
i know it makes me feel like a member of a community plus i can meet new and attractive lady dinosaurs
man we're going
my friend tonight not only do we get to party but we get to party while eating free delicious snacks
okay
wait what
rejected
the heck i was way better than most of the people there it's discrimination
i was told that someone of my ahem 'stature' didn't belong under stage lights for crying out loud
it's so aggravating
they wanted a short orange guy and i gave them a tall green guy and they threw me to the curb
that was muchas delicious but did little to resolve the disparate issues raised by today's events
i bet that if i was absolutely universally honest and never told anyone even a tiny lie again i'd become the most popular and respected dude ever i would probably become known as cap'n honest
good thing anything that ends up with someone getting a new nickname is worth doing
so dromiceiomimus assuming you and i share the same general reference point a similar set of aesthetics plus senses and ways of interpreting those senses that can be trusted it appears to be a very pleasant day today
i believe that i believe that it may or may not be a nice day for stomping on things yes
you do
oh it's true the only viable solution is to never speak again
how come everything's so expensive
seriously everyone how come
i don't know dromiceiomimus everything seems pretty expensive to me it's becoming clear though that my sense of what a good deal is froze when i was about fourteen years old inflation since then causes my sense of being ripped off to increase daily
oh it's already begun
look at me i'm complaining about the present by comparing it to how things were back in my day i'm stereotypically old utahraptor
great actually
i feel like eating food carefully and interacting with technology in ways that would be embarrassing to any younger people i'm with
 thereby fulfilling the stereotype as i understand it
i just realized that if the universe lasts forever infinitely forever then anything that can happen will happen it has to because of infinite time
infinite time kick ass
but dromiceiomimus infinite time that means that the possibilities are endless there must be a timeframe where we're all pirates or whatever
dude infinite time things get crazy
yes but
 our understanding of entropy could be wrong
that's true
oh shoot it's so easy
and so fun and a recipe for a one man party
okay so the first secret to being patronizing is to react to everything people do with an aloof amusement as if it's so precious that they did something all on their own aren't you just so special dromiceiomimus
aw sure they do dromiceiomimus here let me give you a pat on the head you've earned it
another great secret is to call people champ
what's up champ something bothering you
don't you worry about it champ here have some lego if you try super hard you can get some to stick together
aww don't worry champ not everyone gets it on their first try
 anyway forget infinite time i have a better idea what if this universe is just one of many
 okay people have had my awesome idea before but
 but my idea is actually different because what if these universes all exist at once right now regularly spaced throughout an inifinitely huge multiverse instead of infinite time infinite space then trillions and trillions of kilometres away from me in every direction is another universe with another me
 infinite high fives all around
 what not again
 friggin' scientists
 how do they come up with all my ideas before i even articulate them
 man
 these guys are on the ball
hah hah yep
they were fine it's a slide people are meant to fall down it
i was tired
i don't know it's in the attic you can clean it out if you want
aww a touching ending
also this one time i ate a whole lasagna before dinner but my parents got me in heaps of trouble
sociopaths view other people as obstacles
isn't that weird
hah there's a lot of crazy things about sociopaths the whole callous unconcern for the feeling of others incapacity to feel guilt and to profit from past experience and disregard for social norms for example
no reason
certainly no sociopathic reason utahraptor
certainly no sociopathic reason
hah hah come'ere you i was just fooling around
give me a hug
who is the best at eatin' cupcakes the probable answer is t rex because my goodness i ate seven cupcakes yesterday all in a row
and guys i wasn't even trying that hard
ah dromiceiomimus that's actually better at it than i an easy way to remember is to include the to be verb you're dropping better at it than i am sounds right while better at it than me am does not easy
it wasn't meant to be
it's true plus you've got to be eternally vigilant with your own grammar lest you mess up yourself
and yet i do it freely that's because i live on the edge utahraptor
that's because some days i take an envelope out of hte box and i push it
i just got off a bus featuring the world's cryiest baby oh man what a relief
here's a tip some babies need to learn to cry a little less
i know i know i was just a little irritable and making jokes i don't actually blame the baby dromiceiomimus
no
i just wish it'd cried less i'm sure if the baby and i got to know each other we could be friends
no man i love babies some of my best friends used to be babies
why would you even say that i'm the only one that can hear you
hello everybody i'm back in the present after going way the heck back in time to kill a great dictator for the common good
now to convince my friends that i'm not coo coo krazy
dromiceiomimus i'm back from the past where i've changed the timeline to remove someone bad from history isn't that plausible
my only evidence is how incredibly plausible my story is i would rate it super plausible
oh yeah
go ahead ask me anything i bet i'll get it wrong
you know what's dumb not believing my incredibly plausible story
what the hell
aw man what do you want
t that's actually a really interesting question
the question the devil just asked me about orphaned games
it's actually just a subset of the larger problem of orphaned works still under copyright how can such works be dealt with when it's impossible or prohibitively expensive to figure out who owns the rights
but copyright laws as applied to software is really interesting come on
i think i put too much symbolism into random encounters with people i meet on the street i see them as a microcosm for larger society
it is a problem with me
for example the other day i saw some kids who had dropped their bag of marbles it was a stereotypical image of childhood but when i stopped to help them pick them up they said no don't touch them please
ouch man what went wrong can we no longer trust a stranger's helping hand
well these kids couldn't
my mood was off for the rest of the day because of it i was worrying about communities and stuff
it's actually been on my to do list for a while now if you can believe that
everyone be just like me
as i was drifting off to sleep last night i rolled over and discovered there was a bug in my bed with me right on my pillow
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
well i ate it problem solved
tada
sure i do
i know it's been in my bed
aw man do those exist
these bugs aren't made out of what i think they are are they
other poo bugs
i've decided to write a story about my own team of superheroes that's right they're called
the incr the fant the sweet dudes
so far i've got four people on the team the first is justin time who has time based powers the second is justin case who can control probability the third is chix diggit who is an attractive dude if i do say so myself and the last member is tim foresnax who can eat a lot if he wants to they fight crime and prejudice and have romantic mis adventures
nope it is 100% my creation
well justin time goes by his middle name tehnikov because having two justins on the team would be confusing get it
their names sound like common phrases that people might say sometimes just in the nick of time hee hee
it's pretty implausible that someone named justin time would end up having temporal powers though
time to make some life decisions set some life goals
that's right ladies i am going to be a dude with direction
but this isn't just a ploy to seem more comely to members of the attractive sex i really feel like i need a goal to work towards something that i want to achieve in the past i've always just gone with the flow
go to school okay then university okay then get a job
and then work at that job or at better jobs as they come along until i get married and later on die the end
yep somehow
get big and smart
eat my weight in chocolate
learn how to fly rockets or something
i went through a document of 100 million english words and counted each of them you'll never guess what the most often used verb form in the english language is
it's is
the second most often used is was then be and are and have and had
this is not my fault people just talk about being and having a lot what we need to do is spice up our conversations with more interesting verbs
yes motion passes
dude that's not a conversation that's just using a victorian era verb which means to chew one's food thoroughly without any context
oh okay i guess i do a little
d do you want to do it at your place or mine
one of the great myths of our time is that the trick to becoming good at something is to practice it over and over
i'm afraid that i must respectfully disagree
proof by counterexample i have probably practiced eating hundreds of thousands of times and yet sometimes i screw it up practice clearly hasn't helped me here because i should be super awesome at eating things now
i choke it goes down the wrong tube or whatever it's very embarrassing and sometimes i require medical attention
perhaps it's a focus you don't have dude you forget that i am extremely intense
and i can prove it too ask me how my day was
friggin' intense
time to check up on that utopian society i founded i bet everything is totally perfect there in utopia land
they moved
my utopian society moved dromiceiomimus they moved away
just that they packed up everything they could and moved somewhere else and it's not somewhere nearby they clearly thought things would be more utopic if they moved further away from me argh i hate those guys so much right now
huh
that's ridiculous they didn't phase out of existence for the sake of a pun you're just using this as an excuse to cram an etymology lesson where it doesn't belong
colour me impressed
okay so i take a picture of myself with my digital camera put it on my computer and then digitally alter it i make it appear like i'm snow boarding or meeting famous people or something something that is at least plausible
then i upload the altered image back to my camera thereby forming the perfect prank
 now all i have to do is show people the pictures on my camera and they'll assume they're authentic because you can't alter a photo like that in camera i will exploit the expectation that most people only copy images from and not to their digital cameras for comedic effect tee hee
people will fall for this for sure
i sure do baby
hey god check out these awesome pictures i got on my camera
okay nevermind
so who here wants to talk about feelings wooo everyone loves a dude who talks about feelings right
feelings let's talk about them
dromiceiomimus how do you feel today
hey i feel fine too would you like to talk about it for a few hours because that's always a good idea
secretly neither would i high fives
you probably did my friend
oh um i was sort of making fun of talking about feelings but we can actually talk about them too this is because i am a good friend
a good friend who keeps such conversations in strict confidence no less so tell me about your problems
do you have any problems with sexy stuffs
i was asked for money on the street today and after i gave what change i had i was told quite aggressively by the guy that it wasn't enough this can only mean that it's time once again to discuss everyone's favourite topic
panhandling
and it's a tricky issue giving money to beggars can be helpful but some feel it encourages bad behavior and undermines the work of social support organizations plus there is always the rumour of beggars who take home hundreds of dollars a day on the other hand there may well be people for whom begging is the only means of support they have
it's intentional
i really don't know very much about panhandling and a lot of people feel really strongly about it i don't know i usually try to learn more about things by doing them but if i panhandled i'd be a total poseur
man you're on
wait
this belittles us both
i gave them to my mother for her birthday what a good son
hmmm they tasted like regular meat sticks i guess
like spicy leather i wouldn't have eaten them under normal circumstances but you know free internet ostrich meat
they were so vile i literally could not understand it
only briefly it turns out they're meant for the elderly not for virile young dudes they don't say this on the package though
nooo way
'cause it's a beanie cap with a glow in the dark propeller on top
okay thanks for that
does it really matter which idiolect you use
well why don't you just check to see what others are doing
yeah he's worried he won't look cool in front of his fellow gamers if he speaks with numbers in place of letters
that doesn't sound so bad
hey who wants to come with me to sneak around in abandoned buildings
i know you want to dromiceiomimus
it's urban exploration we poke around in abandoned factories and schools and mental institutions and stuff but not to steal things just to look at how things have changed since the building was in use it's awesome you see old bathtubs and all sorts of stuff
yeah man
the difference is that infiltration includes exploring buildings that are currently in use like subway systems and stuff going places you're not supposed to go we're only going to buildings that haven't been in use for years it's more like trespassing
hooray we got to feel what it would be like to be the last person on earth surrounded by the decaying remains of civilization
 one more thing checked off on my lifetime 'to do' list
well i'm perfectly content time to mix things up by staying awake for 41 hours
it's going to be great this is the best idea ev
i'd never want to eat polluted excited pork meat dromiceiomimus i just invented it and i never want to eat it
just think about it polluted eww and what does excited mean when applied to meat it just raises too many questions
i wouldn't be able to enjoy it
last night i ate lots of pears by mistake
what if i'm a new form of dinosaur that can get tired but that doesn't actually require rest i'd never know until i did something like this
are you jealous of my mutant dinosaur powers
ahh oh my god that was not exciting or romantic at all
i would have words with the people in charge of aphorisms
does language alter the way we think sources say perhaps
this source says definitely yes
i think it's a subtle but pervasive effect if a language doesn't have a word for something i think i'm less likely to think about whatever it is that word would refer to for instance in english we have words for friends but what if we had a single word for the phrase friends who deserve pie more often i bet i'd consider buying people more pies
yeah
aww i really respect you and wish to spend more time with you in a romantic fashion too
time for mutual kisses
you know how vanilla extract smells really good but tastes really gross when you drink it
i think this is very symbolic for something
maybe it's symbolic for love great in moderation but you can ruin it by taking too much i e smothering the person with affection
it's a possibility i guess hmmm
yep
i don't know vanilla extract not many people talk about it so i thought i thought i'd be the first
that's a little weird but okay
ah the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you
pretty crazy
following this rule i could feed my vegetarian friends delicious steak sandwiches because that's what i'd like mmm mmm delicious
aha so much for the golden rule there's a lot of other awesome variants anyway
apparently dude
now i'm all about do unto others as they do unto you notice the lack of a would have actually now i'm all about do unto others before they do unto you no wait do unto others at the same time as they are doing unto you that one is about doing things together with friends i think
i notice you are leaving could my conversational stylings be partially to blame
you know what makes me irrationally angry it's people who say the moon landing was faked
argh i am getting angry just thinking about it
because it feels useless because most of these people just want to take on of the most transcendental achievements of our time and belittle it any way they can they're not interested in facts
no well yes
i don't know it's just that we're in a special place in history now where it still matters that we've been to the moon once moon travel becomes routine people won't care so much but right now the landings are unique they're still special
man i don't count i was talking about official visits to the moon mine were in a strictly unofficial capacity
you have my assurances
this vaguely racist form of comedy relies upon the double entendre it narrates the advice of a man called confucius who delivers many a bon mot
for example confucius say man who run in front of car get tired
ho ho did you catch the comedy there there are two meanings in that phrase if you don't get it don't worry the key to emulating understanding is often just to repeat the last word or phrase fake a laugh say hah tired and you will be set
well
as you know there was in fact a real confucius he lived in the 5th century in ancient china then called china and was and is an incredibly well respected philosopher
so yea you've got to be careful because the real confucius said many non hilarious things
phrases like they who know the truth are not equal to those who love it are not meant to be laughed at so don't even try
to conclude i hope people needed this joke explained because otherwise i've been hardcore wasting my time today
some larger cities are plagued by advertising trucks trucks paid to just drive around in the downtown core with giant advertising placards mounted on the back the hell i disagree with this in the strongest way possible
and generally i'm a seriously easy going dude
they're just so wrong they're causing unnecessary pollution in an area that already probably has problems with air quality plus they're congesting the road and making our cities more corporate and less beautiful they're ugly and the whole idea is self centered and thoughtless and the worst kind of capitalism
really you don't think i'm going overboard
i've written a draft of a new book the book is called how to be awesome
i know it's totally the book i was meant to write
in the book i tell people that the key to being awesome is to do awesome things at awesome times
you're right i'm not certain if overusing 'awesome' is in fact awesome i'll cut it out for a bit while i consider the issue
um it's called how to be
and in the book i tell people that the key to being is to do things at times
hey it'll rule
i now realize that replacing 'awesome' with a semantically similar word rather than dropping it entirely would have been a more viable course of action
live and learn bitches
my stars do i ever love documentary films the best form of filmmaking
as i see it yes
what i've come to love is the tension between filmmaker and subject the way editing can so easily be used to slip the filmmaker's politics into the film the veneer of realism the claim of legitimacy ooh it's all so good there's politics in every film sure but only documentary makes the claim of truth and it's that claim that makes it all so interesting
dude it's so good
my favourite are the extended takes where you ask your subject a question they answer it and then you hold the camera on them for a good ten seconds afterwards while they glance around and look ridiculous
yep t that's what i think
i
um
intelligent design or id is the idea that while we may begin to understand the universe through science it is actually created with divine intent evolution is not the chaotic product of random mutations but rather intentional
much as a watch implies a watchmaker so does our universe imply divinity
okay it's a very nice idea but it's not science because it's not disprovable you either believe in intelligent design or you don't and there's no way to show who's right that's not science that's faith
of course not
right
but there's nothing in id as i've formulated it to say that the two can't exist peacefully one just doesn't belong in science class because it's not a science it belongs in religion class
he says there's some merit to both sides of the issue
things sure would be different if one day the speed of light slowed down to something like half a meter per second for some reason
yes indeedy
for one games of hide and go seek would be more complicated also if you were a long distance runner it would be more difficult to run because when you went faster that light you couldn't see where you were going
i think so maybe
how's that
you know what i'm not even certain if it's possible to travel faster than light i'm going to ask professor science
dude he's a diplodocus with one of those square graduation hats on him what is not to like
why isn't anyone attending their classes guys class is on it's time to go to class
what the heck is wrong with everyone in this universe
i just don't understand why nobody is going to class
dude you know what i say i say forget class
hello i play by my own rules rule number one no going to class baby
rules two through five are various socio economic and anarchic justifications for not going to class rule six says it's really too bad that all the ladies are in class right now
my philosophy she has her limitations
today i am selling compliments
 for profit
dromiceiomimus i have some very special compliments for sale would you like to buy a compliment gorgeous that one is on the house
an insult and an implication that my business model is not sound
you really sure
i was sort of expecting that you'd point out flaws of my home business but sure i'd be glad to sell you one
i can hook you up with an attaboy special which includes a five word compliment and a firm handshake
you are a good dude
suddenly you are not such a good dude
i have accomplished much today and it's not even noon yet i feel as if i could take on anything and anyone and succeed
and ladies i am all about putting theories into practice
dromiceiomimus give me a challenge
something difficult
something difficult yet possible dromiceiomimus my stars this is like a 1920s comedy routine without the punchline
man anyway i'll come up with my own incredible challenge
aw but man i was looking for a challenge i wawnted to do anyway yeah i can do it easy easy peasy japanesey

is that racist
learning a language is hard it is especially hard with your first language when you're a baby who has to figure out an entire grammar and vocabulary just from what people say to you
it's not just hard in fact it may well be impossible
it turns out that natural languages are so complex that we probably can't figure out all their rules just from hearing words spoken around us but we can approximate these rules and get very close so the result is we as learners end up speaking a language we're able to communicate with wut which is slightly different than those that surround us
that depends on the learner i guess
rules that are used everyday are going to be more fixed because there's more of a chance somebody will correct you but less frequent parts will be more malleable which explains why languages evolve so quickly
yep of course this has changed a little with the advent of grammar books and formal schooling but it's still there for example i might think the word 'tenet' is enraging
screw you
what's with mainstream music nowadays it's all so bad if i wanted facile lyrics i would just write them myself and make sure not to try very hard
all the music i hear on the radio has lyrics by timmy
plus i saw this painting of a woman the other day and it was clear that the painter had no idea what he was doing it's as if someone just described to him in passing what a woman looked like and he was all i got it guys everything was just a little off it was a portrait by timmy
he's a rhetorical dude
he's also my new critical trademark when something is really juvenile i'll say it's by timmy it implies so much earnest ineptitude
man i already did that with my safe sex campaign remember it is almost certain that you will contract stds from guys named timmy
hah hah ouch for timmy
oh my goodness i feel sick to my stomach today i woke up and i felt sick to my stomach already
ten roasted chickens for dinner i believe the answer is heck yes
i don't understand it i was not around any sick people i did not eat any bad food and yet ouch my stomach
i had ten whole chickens dromiceiomimus mmm mmm
no way
they were very delicious chickens i would eat them all again given the chance
alright i admit it i knew it was bad for me but i ate them anyway and sometimes i don't clean my house as often as i should oh and one time i pretended i was deaf
i i got caught
oh goodness cryptography it's really interesting
specifically trapdoor functions are super interesting times two
these are functions that are easy to compute but difficult to reverse engineer unless you have the secret 'trapdoor' information for example the product of two prime numbers p and q is not hard to figure out if you know their values it's just multiplication but if all you have is the answer n guessing what p and q are can take a really long time
and yeah functions like this are a basis of cryptography
well say i send n to you and you know what the secret value of p is there's a chance my message might be intercepted by a bad guy but this dude will only know n not p
yep of course all this lets us do is communicate a prime number q in secret to each other but you can probably do even more things with trapdoor functions
i'm almost certain
here is a startling thought what if the things i believe in are wrong
i'm serious this is a big concern for me
it's the reason i've never really attended any political marches i can only rarely convince myself that i believe in something so much that those who don't share my beliefs are wrong and need to be publicly convinced otherwise i'm always conscious that i may one day look back on my present day self and shake my head
not necessarily
i'm just left with an acute awareness that i could be wrong about some of the things i currently believe in not big things like racism but little things like mohawks
no man
i think racism is bad it's like when you say you're fundraising for cancer you're not in favour of it you want to cure it that's what i meant
alright t rex not necessarily racist
here is a list of things that were once totally cool and remain so
flappers
and this is where my list derails so that i can talk about flappers oh goodness flappers these were the 1920s equivalent of hipsters only they looked like boys and had way better slang the way they talked was the berries that means something was great
it could well be utahraptor
nope it gives me hope because one day i could meet someone who actually talked like a flapper and then we could get married
man what was i talking about it was a terrible idea to marry someone just because of her cool slang
i really need to think long and hard about my life decisions
man how great would it be to have a tattoo assuming it does not go disastrously wrong it would be super cool
oh you know the usual i get a tattoo of some figure in popular culture and it turns out that figure is crazy racist we've all been there right
we've probably all been there
like twin tattoos
yeah i guess i was hah hah that would be pretty crazy
we'd have to press our tattoos together to make them line up and all the people would think we're married plus what if we got the tattoos on our lips
okay i'm going to stop talking now
aw man i don't want to tell anyone my few remaining embarrassing secrets come on
no
okay okay fine i'll tell one embarrassing secret and that's it
but all you're getting is one secret no more
apparently you are and the secret is this when i lost my virginity i had the song tubthumping by chumbawamba stuck in my head the entire time i just really liked the song i remember being afraid i would hum it afterwards
now don't go around telling that secret to anyone else okay
that was so improbably fast
i've decided to stalk a friend hah hah why not i will be the person they least suspect
this is because i'm violating the understood limits of our friendship
dromiceiomimus i'm going to let you in on a secret okay i have decided to stalk utahraptor can you help me out
right we are not allowed to murder him
hee that's too bad
hee hee
cheese it the fuzz
tonight is hallowe'en and that means
 treats hooray hooray for treats
sure am i have decided that giving it up when i achieved pubescence was a mistake i am going to dress up and go door to door and get candies woo all i need is a costume and a way to minimize embarrassment
that's okay
i'll just be late that's all late with my pillowcase full of candy
hi guys it turns out the reason adults don't go trick or treating is because you get berated at every house for being too old also some kids tricked me and stole my costume
it has been a night of revelation
is it possible to have too many friends
the answer is definitely yes
this is because if you were friends with everyone ever in the history of time you'd have so many people who'd expect you to talk with them on the phone and hang out with them and stuff and there's only so many hours in a day eventually you'd end up snubbing at least some of them which is bad
therefore yes it is possible to have too many friends
how so
i don't have too many friends i was speaking hypothetically
i could use some more friends actually i tried calling an escort service once but it turns out that is a euphemism and all the people there were just interested in sex for money
i was like hah hah what
well i certainly hope i don't get prematurely invited to any parties today
what but it's barely november you're planning this now
i i guess i don't have any other plans
huh that was weird
dromiceiomimus invited me to a party like two months in advance but more weird was that i was actually musing about not wanting to be prematurely invited to any parties just before she spoke to me it's incredible
i know i'm freaking out over here this is me
huh can anyone explain the conflux of these two events
that's seriously me right now
you know what's better than school not being in school but still learning
yes indeed i have decided to become autodidactic
this means that i eschew formal schooling and learn on my own terms at my own pace dromiceiomimus i learn things that interest me and don't rely on someone else to tell me what i should and should not know
shhh
well i've also incorporated into my auto didacticism a distrust of schools as inefficient repressive institutions it's part of my new damn the man persona
i can demonstrate my friend ask me where i picked up a word like autodidacticism
not from any school
nobody can kiss me today because i'm sick
sorry ladies
while you may have wanted a smooch just now dromiceiomimus you can't have one because i'm sick i have a cold
m maybe tomorrow
no
it's true
but i'm also creating an artificial shortage of t rex kisses to increase demand would you say you irrationally want some of my kissing now
try harder
i recently heard about an event called the race for the cure
it sounds cruel to me
why not just give the cure to all the sick people for free they're in no condition to be out racing
i'll say i am who are these creeps anyway
but there's no cure for cancer
what nerve
it's shameful
the race for the cure must be stopped
i have a possibly inappropriate question
do i dare ask it
maybe
both
i carry my stress in my lower back
so if i was paralyzed from the chest down would i not feel my stress anymore
so did i just find a cure for the stress of the modern world or what
do you think it would work
i'm willing to accept yes
#/usr/local/bin/qwantz
# t rex pl
i've decided to start speaking in perl more often it's my favorite computer language
well for one thing it's an extremely portable language that means it works in all sorts of environments without many differences
do they need powerful word parsing in uganda try perl's regular expressions
for example if you said showers and i said s/sh/fl/ you'd get flowers
s/that's c/i'm h/
s/see/boo/
i sometime wonder if i've become too dependent on my daily routine
i think i need to start thinking outside the box
i will imagine that this house is the box my stomping of said box will symbolize my ability to effect change in my life
do not lessen the metaphor
since i stomp the girl every day she represents my daily routine
oh yeah well this next one represents you
look at me i'm a stupid utahraptor i wish i had life all figured out like t rex
 left elbow down right elbow up the crazy utahraptor thinks i have ocd
 open mouth i wonder what that stands for overly competent dinosaur
 left foot stomp house or perhaps outstandingly creative dialogue hey dromiceiomimus did you hear utahraptor thinks i am one cool dude
 turn around stomp girl hey utahraptor i really appreciate that you think i'm oh so clever and delightful
oh crap detected
holy crap there's a bomb in the comic
if i stop stomping the comic will explode
i must stomp unceasingly or we are all surely doomed
i must heroically continue to save us all
it's okay it was full of cans
you see what you've done you've distracted me from my stomping now the comic will explode
now that he is gone i can freely admit that there never was a bomb i just wanted an excuse to stomp
i am reliving the same day of my life over and over again until i get it right
i will prove it to you i know what will happen before it happens watch i am about to stomp a house
you see that proof
i knew you were going to say that
really what
oh yeah well i predict that you're a stupid
how did i know you see that proof
hey you know what i don't like anymore stomping
it's so overdone i no longer enjoy stomping
irony haven't you heard it's cool to do things you no longer enjoy
nostalgia
it's been so long that i've enjoyed stomping that it has come back in style
irony and nostalgia are no longer in the big thing now stomping
bill cosby is the greatest actor of all time
ha ha old billy cosby
don't you love bill cosby mr pterydactyl
oh whatever you look the same
i love bill cosby
maybe i will
yeah so so what what are you trying to say are you trying to say that i'm gay because if you are i'm not you know
hey ryan
ryan hey
you said your catchphrase every time you say what some goofy music plays so the audience knows when to laugh and applaud
but think of the potential you the hip twentysomething man about town me the bumbling but goodhearted roommate think of the possibilities for humor and hijinks
hijinks have ensued
after several years of study i think it is safe to say that i have a firm grasp on the nature of reality
news flash reality is super awesome
 my comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of the universe gives me complete control over every aspect of existence i am an omnipotent stud
it isn't
then i am going to be requesting a refund for that correspondence course
sally struthers you should be ashamed of yourself
i find it exquisitely funny to give someone a nickname that is at odds with said person's true identity
nicknames
for example i would nickname you fat d because in reality you are quite svelte
gasp
he must have been talking to someone behind me
today is a good day i think for trying to explore the very limits of my own body
by which i mean examining instinctual responses of course
i find the idea of instincts interesting what's it like having a drive to do something but not really understanding why have i ever felt an instinctive urge like that
well i intend to find out using the power of science coupled with the power of auto experimentation
totally sucky
i can't figure out what i should be testing what are some instincts people have
ooh or i could surround myself with attractive and sexually available women and then try not to have the intercourse with them
experiment approved
there was a mouse in my house last night a mouse in my house that rhymes
but that's not important right now
this mouse was not only in my house but in my kitchen and on my kitchen counter clearly he needs to die
fine
sadly unchanged
i'm at an impasse i don't want to kill him but i figure if i use a human trap to release him somewhere else i'm just shifting the problem to the new dude whose kitchen he moves into
i don't know i can't look up mice on the internet because my internet is down
dud what about the internet
i don't know what they are man let's talk about something else like chicks
rpgs sound like nerd games that nerds play with with nerds
have you ever played one
i'm not going to hell just to play rpgs
sometimes when people win the lottery they end up getting into a lot of trouble because they don't know how to handle that much money
dear lottery officials i would not have such troubles
i would invest the money wisely and live reasonably my only extravagance would be a pair of diamond studded house slippers and upon my death i would donate them and my riches to charity
huh
what no i wouldn't think of doing that i'm not trying to set up a walt disney esque scheme for tax sheltered reanimation here
these events only serve to further undermine my credibility
man
friggin' events
utahraptor's started his own charity dedicated towards reanimating his body when he dies
what a copycat
it's my idea even if i did do it just by accident now it's like a bizarre arms race seeing who can reanimate their dead body first it's dumb and yet i'm totally going to win
it is and you started it
awww really you'd give up being a reanimated corpse for our friendship
because that's what my charity was looking into reanimating long dead corpses we was gonna make zombies
we we was being straight out socially irresponsible
sure have god
well
back when i was in middle school i used to go to the computer labs and add all sorts of common typos and misspellings to their spell check dictionaries like 'teh' and 'acceptible' and 'amoung' and 'tahn' hee hee
it rules all these kids handed in essays with massive spelling mistakes
pranks are supposed to end in laughter all around
huh mine have all ended with me getting punches to the gut a fre ended in broken marriages
what is this emotion called 'regret'
my favourite food is bread it's the most delicious thing to eat before during and perhaps even after a meal
everyone loves orange juice well except for people who have cuts on their lips but they've made their choice
aw utahraptor that's dumb
that's dumb too the only people who do that are old people who don't want to age anymore and young people who actually i'm not sure if young people even do it
anyway back to bread do i like it because it's so delicious or is it so delicious because i like it
not anymore
when someone says murder is wrong they're clearly making an ethical statement but what are they actually saying let's totally find out
okay so
 murder is wrong
wait was i just saying that it is objectively and verifiably true that murder is always wrong that's a pretty big statement or was i merely saying that it's the societal consensus of most that murder is not such a good idea maybe it's an emotional statement saying i'm against murder personally or maybe it's more of an imperative better phrased as don't murder
that's right baby
i think it's cool that most people will agree that murder is wrong but that they all might have very different ideas of what that actually means we never really specify
a better understanding of ethics plus the ability to not feel bad for accidentally murdering your friends who shoot down your ideas
i mean
oops
if i had the means to design and build my own house it would have all sorts of cool features like skylights and sensible door chimes and high counters designed to accommodate my giant frame
and perhaps a fireman's pole and waterslide
i am so serious about this i would have a fireman's pole the waterslide the waterslide i can see dying on the drawing board but a big brassy fireman's pole is a very freudian way to say ladies i'm the dude with the giant fireman's pole in his house
never
how could i when there'd be a trampoline at the bottom to ensure soft landings and stairs at the side for the elderly and the sissy panted
nope because there'd be a second upside down trampoline too man kapow
i will call my house the house where it's very hard to get any work done
so has anyone here ever ingested any
psychotropic substances
dromiceiomimus have you ever done any consciousness altering drugs
just curious i've never done any but some of my friends have they say they say it's pretty alright
then they rub their faces on the carpet
no way man
i have no interest in being reminded that my mind can be chemically altered or in rubbing my face on the carpet it's just sometimes i wonder if i'm wrong thinking these drugs are not the best idea but
that's exactly it is marijuana addictive who knows this tiny bug on my nose doesn't know
okay
so tiny bug on my nose how was your day today
pleased to meet you morris
that's okay morris everyone gets confused sometimes
aww morris
if you ever need some help getting groceries morris i bet we could help you out
is that why you're on my nose to look for food
i'm going to write the best story ever it's called okay i don't know what it's called but i have a fantastic premise
it's a world where everyone knows how they're going to die
you can go in to a doctor and he takes a blood test and then his machine spits out a piece of paper that says exploded or drowned or poisoned apple and that's it no dates no details and so people who are to die from drowning spend their lives avoiding swimming pools but they end up drowning anyway part of the fun would be seeing how
morbidly interesting
nope cause then you could be killed by an old guy this machine delights in ironically vague deaths
hit on the head by a falling koala bear
it would also work on animals but all the ones for cows would say made into delicious cheeseburger
not that the cows could understand
friggin' cheeseburgers
i think it would be great to have my last words planned out in advance they'd have to be really memorable so that people would keep talking about them and by extension me
unfortunately all the good ones are taken sucks to that
there are a ton of people who have died saying things like i feel fine but irony is overdone in last words it has to be something fresh einstein spoke his last words in german but the only person present didn't speak the language so his last words are lost that's actually pretty neat i think i could learn some obscure language before i die and use that as a backup plan
why's that
ahhh oh wow that's a great one man can you imagine feeling your own pulse stop
hey guys p
pooty pooty
hela cells are a strain of cancer cells that unlike regular body cells can live indefinitely outside the body grow very quickly and don't die form old age they are used in labs worldwide and are in many ways an independent organism
they also helped in the research that eradicated polio
so not only are hela cells the first observed example of devolution or speciation in human beings going from a multi celled life form to a singe celled one but they're also maybe a first example of immortality her cells live but the woman from whom the cells were taken henrietta lacks died from this cancer in 1951 that's crazy
crazier there's probably a greater mass of hela cells now than there was of henrietta when she was alive
well henrietta never found out she was never even told that the cells were being cultivated
and with that i exhaust all my knowledge of henrietta and hela cells i am well and truly tapped
aw man i totally knew that one
also learning is not a competition
i'm going to ignore the symbolism of this
argh i had hoped to avoid this realization but it's inescapable i hate the mall i know it's a cliched thing to hate but it's true i hate the crowds and the cell phones and i hate the music and the consumerism and the shops that don't have anything that i want and i didn't hate but i really disliked the burger i purchased in the food court it had no toppings also it was very dry
i'm not i just feel their pain
and yes i understand that of all the things in the world to get worked up about maybe poverty and climate change are above one soul crushing shopping experience downtown but man the mall
everyone support the implementation of the kyoto protocol
also screw the mall in its stupid face okay
i have a friend who as near as i can tell only dates asian women i don't get it
i don't think he's a racist guy but can you still be racist if you like an entire group of people instead of hating them for some perceived racial qualities maybe but then again there's nothing wrong with finding some feature particularly fetching and maybe all the asian women he meets just happen to have this feature i don't know what to think
huh
no i don't think he has that
i regret never going white water rafting
wow
um wow
she blew all of our fake ass phoney regrets out of the water
let's not invite dromiceiomimus
so i never really found out about mind altering drugs are they a good idea or a bad idea
i can think of one way to find out
i'm going to do mind altering drugs as a science experiment dromiceiomimus
you um well you raise some valid points about my methodology that i really should have considered sooner
postponed
perhaps indefinitely i've decided that this isn't really that pressing an issue for me besides it's not like i'm being pressured to do drugs in the first place it was just for interest's sake
no thank you
i wonder if there are any revelations that would make me want to end a long term friendship with someone what would they have to say
i guess if they were a crazy racist that would probably do it
but then i wouldn't be friends with them in the first place i bet unless they'd kept it hidden until now could i be friends with someone knowing they're a crazy racist and would it make a difference if it never really came up that often
really
well i guess the difference is that nobody will ever get mad at you for being intolerant of racism except for racists
but it's okay because everyone hates racists right
e except for racists
it's definitely time to call in some old debts luckily for me i'm a one man debt collection agency
dromiceiomimus you owe me ten sub sandwiches and i'm calling in the debt
one time and i remember this quite clearly you bet me ten sub sandwiches over something and it was basically pretty clear that you lost
as a matter of fact yes you do
you dear friend owe me like three cases of pop because you bet me a can of pop for every week the sub place stayed open and they've been open for years so yes many soda pops for me
god you ove me several sub themed items too
you know what people don't say often enough anymore
 holy smokes
holy smokes but that's a pretty awesome expression that dude just fell down the stairs holy smokes it has the charm of a child yet is better than the old standby of holy cow because nobody says holy smokes anymore it is forgotten it is undiscovered
holy smokes
wait wait a minute i never had a chance to use it for real
anyway man who says you're in charge of when things become old hat
i will say it again in french friends and neighbors
qui dit que vous tes responsable du moment o les choses deviennent vieux chapeau
today is a good day i think to talk about robots
holy crap yes
oh man robots so awesome what other literary construct allows us to discuss the disparate issues of slavery prejudice identity the body and the self while also allowing for all the trappings of a science fiction setting only robots my friends
i would seriously marry robots if it were even possible
in fact the only fault i can find in robots is with their real life counterparts
they're a canonical study in failed promise they never try to take over the world and rarely act as a mirror of our own essential humanity they just sit around
but man imagine living in a world with literary robots it would be the coolest
so awesome
oh man i haven't bought anyone any presents yet i am so pooched i am the worst friend in the world
this will consummate my social ruin for sure
oh hey dromiceiomimus how's how are things
haha that's cool well i guess i'll see you tomorrow christmas eve i have a very special present for you my friend
why did i say that i am even more pooched than ever before
nope and then i compounded it by telling dromiceiomimus that i had something extra special for her and oh man now you know my secret i'm out of control
i know i know but still
hey
i could give dromiceiomimus my toaster
i have made a very important new year's resolution it's to make sure that my name becomes an eponymous adjective people will soon all describe things as t rexian what sort of things
awesome things natch
wait huh i'm not the sort of person who says natch i never say natch i say naturally and even then only sometimes i have no idea why i said natch just now i'd like to take it back dromiceiomimus
aw shoot my eponym is a disaster
wait let's change it so it means using out of date slang that's still cool like flapper slang or pirate's slang or whatever can we do that
had i finally and irrevocable blown it with my own name had my father's famed and final prediction come at last to pass
daaaaaang
here is a hypothetical situation let's say i'm married and going to have a child with my assuredly hott wife what should it be named
my position is that babies should be named after old girlfriends
not only does it allow excellent names to be redistributed to new children but as we have more kids we'll catch up and eventually one will be named after my wife it evens out everybody wins
they can be named after my wife's ex boyfriends as you can see i've thought of every possibility
they all had quite excellent names
those are terrible names those are names you give to cats that you don't like
okay okay so am i making the best use of my time judging by the success of others the answer may well be in fact perhaps not
i've never really cared about being rich before but on the other hand having disposable income is sort of alright is wanting more money the first step on the path to becoming more and more right wing as i get older such a trajectory is one i have sometimes observed in my peers and elders
neither both
i'm i dunno i guess i'm worried only about getting one shot at life and messing it up or not making the best of it
friggin' gardens of regret
it would be cool to be able to flash forward and see what my life would actually be like in ten or twenty years
cool and improbable
so improbable in fact that i have no idea of how i would accomplish it ah well so much for visions of tomorrow
yep
that's pretty wild
well
i for one would like to register disappointment with every aspect of the future
two words that are homophones sound the same but mean different things
for instance the word awful really bad and the word offal burchered entrails
to begin my stomping on this manner is a sorted little affair take soulless in the fact that at leased ewe are knot being chaste as well
i will here nun of it
i'm saying weird homophones
i was speaking in hilariously inappropriate homophones it was extremely hilarious
 that's it i'll sell naked pictures of myself online for profits
 dromiceiomimus you'll bid on naked pictures of me right for profits
 first off whatever and second off what if i died and you wanted pictures
 no
i have already specified that anti dollars are not allowed to be bid in my auction
do anti dollars really mutually annihilate when combined with regular dollars
science says yes
begging the question is when what you're trying to prove is assumed implicitly in one of your premises
for example t rex is a pretty sweet dude because he's always so friggin' awesome
this is actually formally valid if the premise is true and i'm friggin' awesome then it follows that i'm a pretty sweet dude however i've provided no logical support for my t rex is awesome premise but only made a conclusion t rex = pretty sweet which relies on the premise being true i haven't offered any evidence so i am begging the question
i know it's so wrong
no it does not what it suggests is that everybody sucks but me
oh goodness i am so thirsty my thirst is exquisite sublime immaculate
nopers
i would much rather consider the precise nature of my thirst it's strong insistent
please i am trying to consider the nature of thirst it's stern
aw man
see now what can i do i can't stay here and consider my thirst because that's revelling in what for some people is a terrible fact of their lives but if i go get a drink i'm just underlining my privilege
man everyone has better reasons for being here than me
i've never had any problems with dating someone of a different religion but i imagine under certain circumstances it could be a problem
much like most things
i guess if there was some religious beliefs that one person had and the other didn't it could lead to tension but relationships are about compromise right but if someone say adopts the actions of a religion as a compromise but not the beliefs behind it isn't that just going through the motions which isn't really what most religions are about
how so
that's true luckily as i say this has never happened to me therefore double high fives for conflict avoided
man don' leave me hangin'
raising one eyebrow
i would really like to be able to raise one eyebrow it seems like everyone can do this but me and as a consequence of my being unable to operate my eyebrows individually my facial expressions are limited to either surprise both eyebrows raised anger both eyebrows furrowed or danged neutrality the intrigue of raising a single eyebrow seems destined to remain frustratingly beyond my purview
i'm afraid it was all an illusion
when i feel intrigued i have to say how intriguing or guys i'm really intrigued right now because i can't express it through my face watch say something intriguing
well it probably wouldn't have worked
why purple doesn't rhyme with machine
what is the deal with everyone walking in on me while i'm having showers this has gone well beyond random chance and i am at a loss to explain it
everyone needs to stop walking in on me while i'm having a shower please
and with that i'm off to go have a bath or something
nowhere dear friend i am off to &#8211 go sit and&#8211 read a book about &#8230 famous deserts of the past
man it almost happened just there
this new let's spy on t rex in the shower problem that everyone seems to have &#8211 and now god's in on it too i don't understand also i just realized i lied to god about reading a book
somebody's in here
is it possible to have adventures in today's modern world i mean real adventures like ones where i get to swashbuckle
t rex says probably not
i think we've made our environment so predictable and safe that there's no real opportunity to go where nobody's been before to see things that haven't been seen it's too bad i want adventures
while clearly extreme can such activities truly be considered capital a adventure
i don't know
especially since you'd have to climb up at least part of everest yourself okay you're right
guys i really just don't think i'm as into snowboarding as i used to be
i wish for justified happiness
woooohoooo

oh man ouch shot down looks like no wishes for you
should've wished for ice cream my friend
my euphoria
oh it's true if it was even marginally in style i would grow mutton chops
in a second i love the grizzled prospector look actually no that's not even true i love pretending to be a grizzled prospector the facial hair would just be the grizzly icing on the prospector cake
that's okay i have backup plans
backup plan a is labelled handlebar moustache
sometimes i do i wonder what it'd be like
really
dating both twin sisters at the same time
hot or just in fact kind of weird
i'm afraid that i fall on the kind of weird side of the fence this time while i'm usually in favour of the hot makeouts they're sisters it's like they've made out with each other through proxy transitive makeouts
what's not to get twins proxies transitive closure
things would indeed be different
keep on swimmin' ladies because i love you both super equally
i don't know who i am anymore
i've never had a nightmare or at least i've never remembered them and they've never been enough to wake me up which amounts to pretty much the same thing
i'd like to have some nightmares please
i want some consequence free scares and that sense of that irrational creeping terror that i really don't get in my day to day life
oh i know i know i just feel a little left out when everyone gets to have nightmares but me i feel i feel like the only girl in grade 8 that hasn't hit puberty yet
does it
hah i sure have
hey i have unfocused confusing sexual desires
alright
it occurs to me that democracy is pretty unfair if you're not a dude who's in the majority
it sucks because if everyone disagrees with you then you'll never get anything you want it's majority rule mob rule
yeah but what if the majority decide to be totally racist against you you're pooched
what do they say
right like how i'm in a minority because i sometimese like to sleep in on weekends
really are you serious
have all my years of sleepy shame been for naught
vegetarians are chicks and dudes who don't eat a lot of meat for some reason or whatever
first off you've got your lacto ovo vegetarians who don't eat meat but do eat eggs and milk there's also lacto vegetarians and ovo vegetarians then you've got your vegans who don't eat meat or any animal products so eggs honey milk and cheese are out and even leather sometimes for for shoes
where you be vegetarian for free
that sounds close to flexitarians who only eat meat when being vegetarian would be rude or inconvenient
now i myself am a tremendo meatatarian which means that i only eat meat that i find to be tremendously delicious
yes on account of the golly gosh darned scurvy
i am a dude in need of a catchy slogan something to put under my name on business cards to convince people they should associate with me and maybe be my friend
something like t rex your man in any situation
it is a work in progress
hah no i'm actually looking for slogans that are positive
man that's not positive either
that's even less positive than the first one
no i'd be a tasty taste in the morning
i have long since stopped soliciting suggestions utahraptor
not bad though
the city was dark too dark the kind of dark that could drive a man insane
as i parked my retro car outside of my detective agency i felt for the cool weight of my gun
not just cool temperature wise but cool in that it made me look good too good but i had to look good because my first case of the day was my ex wife fran turns out she was bein' blackmailed couldn't say by who but i had a pretty good idea of who it might be the night was turning out to be a real night to remember
no of course not
whoah ouch last time i narrate any of my stories for you mr critical pants
oh right utahraptor's having trouble with this dude he's been seeing i forgive his critical outburst
i have discovered that i have a weakness me and though i should probably keep it a secret from my enemies i will say what it is
smell associations
is it i can be swayed by smells i loved swimming pools as a child and now the smell of pool chlorine gives me happy memories of swimming
so what if there was an evil politician who smelled like chlorine i might vote for him against all better judgement
i can be mind controlled by smelly enemies i'm a danger to myself and everyone i know
yes this is my concern
you don' know me
fun fact did you know that if you're in a situation where your messages have a chance of being lost or misunderstood then you can never fully share information with someone
it's totally true even if all the messages arrive unmolested
so dromiceiomimus imagine i'm sending you a letter that says hi you get it so now we both know that i said hi but only you know that you know that i said hi so you send a letter that says got it which i get but then i know that you know that i said hi but you don't know that i know that you know that i said hi and so on
we go back and forth sending i got your 'i got it' letters forever
well of course we wouldn't actually do that but the point is that we can never know the exact same information unless it's 100% guaranteed that the messages aren't lost or garbled but the mail isn't like this
i plan on developing several crazy theories about the postal service
i have not okay let's talk about something else
aw man fine i'll ask video games should be video games shouldn't they
well i don't
don't believe that video games can be judged by the same standards as films it's the devil again i think he's trying to convince me to play a video game with him where you don't get to move
right
please do
i have a friendship crush on all my friends they're great
hello dromiceiomimus i have a friendship crush on you
a friendship crush is where you really like a friend but it's not necessarily sexual but everyone makes jokes that it's totally sexual because you like to hang out all the time
but you're not supposed to ask that makes you seem needy it causes my friendship crush to fade a bit

if i were to be reincarnated i would like it to be as one of those big machines that eats smaller machines for an audience
what they're awesome
what you're going to shoot down my idea
some people believe that you can come back as plants they're barely alive
barely so barely i've seriously never been impressed with a plant
don't get me started about sunflowers god their salty boring seeds
okay i may have been a little hard on plants i concede that yes there are some plants that actually do some cool things
for example there's some dogwood plants that have tiny flowers which bloom explosively in something like half a millisecond in doing so they accelerate their pollen at rocket speeds and blast it out at over four meters per second that's some fast pollen and i am not a dude who's gonna say that naturally weaponized flowers aren't cool
and i suppose plants that cure diseases are pretty alright too
well i realized that i do want plants on my side even if most of them just sit there and i do think it's kinda neat how some can turn dirt into strawberries i've got nothing against strawberries
i do love strawberries
i don't know a lot they're alright
to to fully understand my love of strawberries is to fully understand the unblinking eye of madness
i am sick but not in a good way in a sore throat way i am well and truly under the weather
me sick
i never get sick my sculpted body is invincible to all but the strongest strains of disease and malcontent
okay yeah but this is a real sickness this is a serious i should stay in bed so i don't infect my friends sickness
no but
but i thought we we could get through this disease together
what is this emotion called criminal negligence
i wonder what it's like to break up with somebody over the phone there's only one way to find out
dromiceiomimus pretend that we're dating and talking on the phone and i'll break up with you okay
dromiceiomimus there's no time for talking about feelings now we're doing an experiment
man nevermind
yes yes utahrpator pretend we're dating and i'll break up with you over the phone
 hello hello i'd like to break up with utahraptor
man let's get it right this time i dail the correct number call you and try to break up okay
alright who here has some emotional problems they'd like solved once and for all
your friend should be less jealous there is nothing wrong with friendship and you should tell your friend to be less jealous yes this problem is truly solved thanks to logic
i am your man
this occurs simply because these people are placing their emotions over the warm embrace of cold steely logic
i really wish i'd invented fire extinguishers or something man
it would be a great way to be remembered every time someone puts out a fire
not really i just would like to be thought of fondly once in a while every time someone puts out a fire would be often enough for me
nope
but you know that's his fault right he didn't capitalize on it but i would have i'd have the extinguishers say remember t rex he was so great wasn't he guys every time they were use just a soft reminder nothing too loud
although people sometimes shout nooo while using a fire extinguisher on a fire so onlookers might not be able to hear or they might think they're shouting in response to the extinguisher
it would only add to the confusion
oh kay socialism is when people share the means of production and stuff everyone works together for the common good
 for some reason
haha see what i did there dromiceiomimus i implied that socialism is flawed because people don't really have a motivation to share with each other
yeah that that was my joke
hey
holy why is everyone so touchy about the tragic and fundamental flaws of their nature today i'm sorry we all don't share enough but i'm not going to ignore it and hope it goes away i deal with the issues
true but i can sum it up in a play involving everyone wanting some of my delicious ice cream cone
and then we all decide to pitch in and take over the ice cream cone factory
a singularity refers to a future moment when we create artificial intelligences that are smarter than we are it's called this because things will be so different it's impossible to predict past it everything will change
for instance these smart machines could make even smarter machines
and so on until we have super duper smart machines that will look on us as mere playthings will they destroy us or will we merge ourselves with technology and in doing so become a new more cybernetic lifeform our choices seem limited to either becoming something new or facing irrelevance and obsolescence
because too much has changed
also because we're too dumb it'd be like a dog trying to predict what its owner does
right well &#8212 i've never really been one for apt analogies
check it eating food in bed is like &#8212 a crappy duck
what the heck everyone
thesis statement science fiction is a better genre of fiction than fantasy
proof robots are clearly significantly cooler than talking horses
conclusion my thesis statement is correct everyone loves robots and everyone is totally bored whenever they hear about horses with souls that talk about feelings boring feelings
one was enough
they're actually not
it is a common misconception that science fiction is just fantasy with a justification for the fantastic elements what people forget is that science fiction rules and fantasy
precisely my friend in three different ways
come on god would you rather battle klingons on trolls
i would never want to get pregnant having to worry about what i eat because there's a baby growing inside me no thanks
the cravings would be a good excuse for eating all the damn bread but still too much responsibility i'm dangerously carefree
no reason just &#8212 sharing
i don't recall saying that
 i have smelly pants &#8212 utahraptor
man they are molded chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone am i now to apologize for brilliance
people are sad sometimes and that makes me very sad therefore i will dedicate my memorable problem solving skills towards solving the problem of sadness once and for all
way to be happy #1 amnesia forget your problems
this has the problem of robbing you of your present history and self however most people like those things so method #2 is using happiness inducing drugs and alcohol
true but i have other methods method #3 is having a rewarding and satisfying professional and personal life tada
okay
luckily i still have method #4 which is to set unreasonably low expectations for everyone including yourself
man everyone is making it really hard for me to solve the eternal problem of unhappiness
w
wildly misinterpret your own despair
everybody wants to be remarkable here are some awesome ways to be remarkable
the first is to go further in something than anyone has before
for example maybe you could eat a whole lot of goldfish or swallow tons of orange juice simply think of something people already do then think of a reasonable limit to that activity and then shoot past it it's the go further than anybody else would ever want to technique
precisely
aww shooting down my ideas
well i suppose the idea of remarkability ties in with a desire for fame which i suspect is merely a corruption of wanting to be respected
so yeah i can see wanting to be respected but not wanting to be remarkable it almost seems nobler than otherwise
anyway
you can also be remarkable by holy shit memorably cussin'
hey god would you still hang out with me if i didn't have any friends
i'm serious i figure it's harder to make that first friend than it is to make the 20th and i'm concerned that if i moved to a new town where i didn't know anybody i wouldn't have any friends
but that's just it &#8212 i'm just not shy among friends it is a catch 22 in my social life
i don't remember man
i must have been two years old or something but i've used that first friend as a seed to get me all my other friends and now i have this irrational fear that my house of cards will come crashing down around me
wait wait &#8212 i have the solution all we have to do is make a legally binding promise to be best friends forever purely out of fear of being alone
t that's attractive right
i am no longer worried about not having any friends if i move to a new town i have turned a crisis into an opportunity an opportunity
 for personal reinvention
the key is that nobody will know me in this new town which means i could be whomever i want if i present myself as a grizzled prospector no one will be able to say otherwise i could be a race car driver i could be a library scientist
but i could pretend
yes
i mean no it wouldn't be lying it would be reinvention i would be the star trek the next generation to my present original series
yes in all seriousness it would let me put behind myself aspects of my past that i'm not happy with
like everything i've ever done wrong oh god
i like people whose names tell short stories like john went where'd he go ha ha ha
 i don't know
 i also like people whose names are verbs like pat and mary sort of and i really like people whose names are nouns and verbs and adjectives like pine
well perhaps the name is so awesome that people are simply saving it for the appropriate child
 it's alright
 i kind of wish my name was a verb too though instead of just being a noun you can't t rex something i've tried it doesn't work
 my goodness
i regret spilling a glass of ginger ale on an architect
aw man dromiceiomimus wins the regret competition again
we need to do some olympic class screw ups and feel really bad about them if we're ever going to win
she's just sadly staying at home utahraptor man she's probably regretting things right now
fuck me
hysteria was once thought to originate in the womb hystera is the greek word for womb this had the nice side effect of making men immune to it
it's true
aw man
so i hear you're having a minuswomb operation
yes a uter b gone
a womboval
i saw the greatest tv show last night it ruled
it sucked
i am using the second it to refer to my entire experience watching the show of course and not to the show in particular the program was exactly the sort of thing i had long wanted to see on television i had vaguely sort of planned to maybe try my hand at writing television but there's no point now because the talent behind last night's episode have accomplished all that i would have like to have done thanks television industry
please do
 babies sporting monocles
dude we have to steal it
god we're going to steal the kilogram
now we're gonna have to use our cleverness because it's probably well protected seeing how it's the only real kilogram in the entire universe
i have the brash enthusiasm of an amateur and the body of a tyrannosauroid
no one about about nothing
ha ha nope i'd have to be god himself to pull off that impressive caper
hee hee that's it for science bitches
dear poets i am sorry i've been making fun of your craft for over 20 years it is actually harder than it looks
i have been trying unsuccessfully to write a poem for the past half hour i am trying to capture the emotion of getting up early in winter during a heavy snowfall and going for a walk and coming across a set of traffic lights the kind that switch automatically controlling traffic that isn't there traffic that won't be there for hours the sense of seeing them as art of watching them through the snowfall in the crisp dusk of a new day
okay but i warn you it is unfinished
 once upon a time
oh yeah well not if i do this
 dancing is crazy fun to do
are there cash awards for poetry do you know
goodness i haven't been on very many wacky adventures lately it's time to change that it's time for
dromiceiomimus want to go on a wacky adventure with me
that's that's true it is best to be sensible about wack adventures maybe i'll get back to you in a week
i'm wacky i'm ultra wacky
well sure okay okay yeah let's just you know set out for adventure
hah diseases in the water
hello you need to fall in love
everybody needs to fall in love to fall in love is to value another person's happiness above your own to want to be with them and make your lives together the bet they could possibly be are you saying you would not like to love and be loved of course you would your partner is out there looking for you you should probably get on this
you are diluting our message here utahraptor
a private room oh man were you just namedropping m c masturbation
a what
tada the aging machine is completed
dromiceiomimus what have you done today i've just made a machine that makes people age with god's help
no no that would be good but this is actually just a machine that leaks invisible cell decaying radiation
b because god told me to
man you're right what was i thinking well you can rest assured that i'll be taking this up with god at my earliest convenience
so yeah that's why i can never see myself using the word twincest
i am a pretty satisfactory dude and yet sometimes i feel incomplete the reason for this is simple
i've never been moved to tears by music
we have this cultural image of some prodigy beautifully playing the piano while everyone in the audience weeps if i were there i could only look around in confusion i like music sure and some of it is very pretty but to cry about it i wouldn't know where to start with crying pills i guess
you know i have no idea
maybe they do but they're just super spicy pills so people's eyes well up when they bite into them anyway
man that's just because movies have sad narratives music just has a bunch of notes that i am entirely unable to relate to on any emotional level on account of my untrained ears and my magnificent manly heart
can you just ask someone to fall in love with you
perhaps not
but if directly asking them doesn't work what about thousands and thousands of implied requests
what if everything i did was expressly designed to make a certain someone love me
it's not manipulative it's adoring
it's simply directing my self development towards an end result i imagine my target would be happy with as if to say how about now
wait did i say my target i mean my soulmate my sweetheart my mark
my thesis is that when a guy is like am i finally good enough chicks totally dig it
i have written a new story called make way here comes tiny chef
it's about a tiny chef who makes tiny food for everyone
and although he's tiny in size his food is always big on taste oh and there's a scene where he cooks a big banquet for everyone and it's really good and everyone says thanks to him all at once and tiny chef says oh it wasn't any trouble then he smiles and adds actually maybe it was just a tiny bit of trouble and everybody laughs oh tiny chef
really you approve
whoah children's book mine is a book for adults utahraptor my market is fully grown men and women who would like to find out just a little bit more about one very tiny chef
for have we all not woken up in the morning only to ask ourselves what is it really like being a tiny chef in a world of regular sized chefs is there no book to explore this tantalizing question
friends i have good news the answer is no longer 'no'
i'm not going to leave what happens to me after i die up to others what if they put on a weaksauce funeral
people might equate a weaksauce funeral with a correspondingly weaksauce dude
worse what if they bury me in an uncool part of the graveyard
perhaps but i've decided to solve this problem once and for all by arranging my own funeral plot and gravestone myself tada
really
spooky
huh it seems less cool knowing that it's been done before but i guess i could still visit my grave and pretend to be a time traveler who's changed the past the whole noo i changed the past idea you know
like i'm surprised at how sucky a time traveler i am
 bisexuality can lead to all sorts of new and exciting self labels labels like biknowledgeable bisensitive
 bidisillusioned
 hah hah sweet sorry it's not working out bidisillusioned dude
 but dromiceiomimus there's also being bianxious and being bitraumatized biscandalization
 how bistonishing
 of course not
 it's just the verbs and the adjectives anyway i think i know what real bisexuals do
 for your information i have read several websites on the subject
 for instance did you know that whenever women are alone they have pillow fights and then they practise kissing on each other i've seen the pictures
 i mean i mean my friend has seen the pictures
 it's for a project for school
friends are good things to have they can help you out when you are sad a psychological benefit and can lend you money if you need it an economic benefit
it is these positive benefits of having friends that concern me
i'm pretty sure i like my friends because of the people they are but what if i'm just kidding myself what if i really just like them because they're an economic cushion someone to bail me out even literally if i get into trouble
exactly we hedge our bet by having friends
how so
they are even more of an economic benefit they are get out of jail free cards people who you can rely on in any situation
wait my problem's that i'm seeing any positive effect of friendship as income and thus everyone involved in one as compromised in a conflict of interest i would only be happy if having friends was awful thanks rare and brilliant moments of perfect self awareness
i learnt a new phrase today
 intellectual terrorism
 i first thought it was a ridiculous phrase both on its own and with all the phrases it suggested like emotional terrorism and pseudo intellectual terrorism but if ideas are powerful then maybe you can terrorize someone with them maybe then again intellectual terrorism comes very close to saying that ideas i disagree with or find distasteful are wrong and worse damaging and weaponized whatever intellectual terrorism
in just the way you'd think
someone didn't like what they were reading so they defined its contents as terrorism i think they were serious
i am definitely flirting with freaking out right now
today is a good day i think for cleaning up my house goodness
i will clean it up really well i will mop the floors i will mop the walls or whatever i will tear the house down and rebuild it metaphorically speaking i'm illustrating this metaphor by literally stomping on this house
thanks
yes
for you see the woman represents years of build up of grime and dirt by stomping on her i illustrate cleaning power not of any household cleaner but of simply applying yourself
yes to grime and dirt
am i the only dude who truly wishes it were possible to clean a house with metaphors
because it rules
hello
oh yes i have an idea for the best victimless prank ever plus it'll give a cashier a good story to tell dromiceiomimus you've got to help me on this one
dromiceiomimus
dromiceiomimus there you are
dromiceiomimus i need your help with a prank the prank is we all get some really fake stick on moustaches even though we're all of age then we put them on and go into a convenience store and we all buy adult pornographic magazines hee hee
sure can
let's do it
buying this magazine made me feel dirty and ashamed have i once again thoughtlessly aided the exploitation of our nation's topless lesbian teens
who would win in a fight superman or batman
the answer is batman
anyone who doubts this need only remember that batman is really smart and that they're probably wrong
batman has batman skills
oh he'd know
batman doesn't have nappy times
oh god
our friendship has never been so endangered
ladies your attention please are you aware that i'm a predator don't you find that attractive perhaps yes and what if i told you i was not just a predator but also a grade a
 sexual predator
what i'm not making jo oh my goodness i honestly didn't even think that it could be read that way i meant it in the sense of like a basketball player and then a grade a sexual basketball player not in the sex offender sense
aw man that's the end of me
well the real meaning of sexual predator honestly didn't occur to me until dromiceiomimus pointed it out and i had already um sort of registered myself on websites dedicated towards keeping track of sexual predators
dear audio diary today i may have accidentally registered myself as a sex offender what is wrong with my life
all right
time for some funny jokes
dromiceiomimus here's a funny joke a skeleton walks into a bar and orders a drink and a mop
perhaps you are just listening to it wrong it's funny because skeletons have no internal organs hah hah hah how is he animate why is he thirsty it sure raises some funny questions
man forget her animate skeletons are inherently funny
of course i should be able to say animate skeleton and people should just start laughing for my encore i could say he's thirsty what a thirsty thirsty animate skeleton
right imagine that
hmm
hey have they ever made a video game where you get to control a car and your goal is to get it to grow up into a bigger car
because they totally should
and so it's like you need to care for your car to make it grow up into a truck and then an suv and if you're lucky a monster truck maybe a plane weird cars grow up into boats
yes people are tired of animals as pets they want cars that age i know because i played a game once and that's what i wanted
dude i already said
you take care of little cars and then they grow up into awesome cars or stupid lookin' boats the end fifty points
 oil treats come on it's called changing the oil and it gets you a +1 happiness in car car simulator trucko boat 3
will no one make my video game dream a fevered reality
what a beautiful crime free vigilante filled day
oh hellow dromiceiomimus i hear you had a super day today
whoops right i gotcha i will keep things on the down low it's our secret our secret identity
our our secret
hey
hey have you seen dromiceiomimus today i hear she's got a secret a secret one might even classify as super
no i'm just suggesting that if a building falls on you you might want to call her first
i seriously just can't stop blabbing about dromiceiomimus's secret identity
i have finally come up with a way to become immortal it's perfect because i don't have to do anything except die and i was already probably going to do that anyway
yes all i have to do is be reincarnated indefinitely
isn't that great dromiceiominus we can have this conversation as many times as we want i can stomp on things forever
aw man sucky dogs poo bugs
poo bugs are scientifically the lamest sorts of bugs
well i can't stop now besides if i do come back as a poo bug then there's not much damage i can do right maybe i'll get stomped on by some other dude pretty quickly and it'll be so tragic that next time i get to be an awesome t rex again
success
i have a secret the secret is that i absolutely ate potato chips last night instead of a real dinner
nobody must ever find out my awesome secret
so dromiceiomimus what's up
that's cool that's cool listen i believe that it's critically important to have three square meals a day okay that's what i believe
awesome
well that should throw her off the trail
oh um throw women off the trail of my feelings
you know it
man that movie rocked right guys
i dunno i liked it
dear guy whose car alarm went off last night outside my window at three in the morning
forget you man
your car alarm is ridiculous years of trigger happy alarms have trained the public to ignore them and nobody would care if your tastelessly noisy car got stolen anyway if someone had driven off in it last night as the alarm was blaring i would have applauded him this is what you've done to my sense of civic responsibility
the honest answer is heck yes
i would have smiled as i drifted back to nappy times but in my defence i was really tired plus the guy was a jerk he was all man if my car gets stolen i want the whole block to know my car is totally important to everybody
oh man let's go to the beach and hang out in flattering swimsuits
now this is what i call an interesting narrative
it's time for some embarrassing stories
dromiceiomimus do you have any embarrassing stories you feel like sharing
well i suppose that's fair i did kind of put you on the spot maybe maybe next time
and maybe utahraptor will have some embarrassing stories
man i don't want to be the only dude with an embarrassing past you must have something
that is so barely embarrassing
i've actually done that too
the saddest thing i can imagine is a kid who's very sick but who still loves to play marbles in the park he's got a mobile iv and one day it gets stuck in a storm drain on the way to the park and in trying to free it he loses all his marbles in the sewer
aww i'm sorry imaginary dude
it's true huh thanks for the advice dromiceiomimus
huh
it totally works i just thought that losing a job would be sad but a poor little injured puppy losing its job that's heartbreaking
dromiceiomimus i've come up with a new saddest thing ever
a universe where we never became friends
awww
 live every day like it's your last how hard could it be
upon closer inspection forget that noise
i'm not going to live my life according to a dumb clich saying and anyway if i did it would be ridiculous because i'd either end up spending each day in increasing terror trying to do something universally memorable or more heartwarming spending each and every day thanking my friends for their love and watching the sunset while quietly weeping no thanks
i guarantee it
you know what i find the existence of those plans doubtful
oh man a sunset boo hoo hoo
i will become rich and famous by becoming the world's best baker my flagship product will be brilliant it will be rich delicious low fat
 gender rolls
hee hee get it dromiceiomimus they're rolls like bun rolls but also gender rolls
no those are sex rolls gender rolls are shaped like housewives and firemen
dude it is certain
they're animal crackers for a new generation come on it's a great pun plus every time you go into my bakery you can choose your own gender roll it's brilliant
they do if they want to use the washrooms dammit
ha i have made a hilarious typographic error
but how to profit from it
i have started a radio show it is an advice show people can call me and i will give them advice on all of their problems from being locked out of their house to being emotionally locked out of their house in a relationship
i call it i know i'll ask t rex about my stupid problems
this is a good thing stupid problems like i bought too much mayonnaise are easy to solve the solution is to give away return or consume the extra mayonnaise
easy my mom answers them
we're going to team up i'll answer the silly questions and there'll be a feature called ask t rex's mom where she'll answer all the hard questions moms are really good at things like that
aw mom
there are some phrases usually joined by and or or that we always say the same way even though it would make logical sense to say them another way for example i am sick and tired of these phrases
or am i merely tired and sick of them
eh dromiceiomimus pretty awesome by saying the words of these phrases in unpopular order i subvert people's expectations and the bolts and nuts of language itself
aw you're not interested you just want some quiet and peace you're not falling for this sinker line and hook
that i have blown people's minds
also that i have played loose and fast with language
the point my friend is that you should come over for dinner tonight
maybe you'd all like to come and have some dinner first
sleeping with the window open second best thing ever
or absolutely the best thing ever
sure do i love getting a fresh breeze on my face and smelling the dew on the grass or whatever that night time smell is it's great in summary and in conclusion if there's a sleeping with the window open fan club sign me up to be el presidente
and ammo
we're doomed damn this dystopian future what kind of world have we made for our children
sleeping with the window open still rules though
man it's a totally awesome day today and it will probably be a totally awesome evening to and perhaps even a totally awesome night
yes today is looking up
you know what we should have a party tonight at my place just because it's so nice could you come
awesome
sweet
it'll be pretty mellow but i will be absolutely certain to buy some delicious snacks so we can have tasty things to eat everyone loves tasty things
i in particular sincerely enjoy tasty things
aw man i seriously forgot to buy any snacks i am the worst party host ever
am i now to live in a world where all my future impulses towards spontaneity will be tempered by a small measure of regret
i am against giving your sweetie flowers when you are in a relationship oh god think of the symbolism
the horrible symbolism
no way they represent affection right they represent your love but they die in like a week no matter what you do i don't need no punkass flowers reminding me that everything beautiful dies sooner than i want to believe
i buy potted plants
they're still in the ground so they last for years tada
true however the plants now also serve as a constant reminder of me and how i need water viz smooches
i am writing a book called relentless reminders of physical neediness maybe she'll like you now
here are some of the worst things i've ever done by accident accident one slapped someone right in the face
kapow
i didn't see them there that's all
who can say all we really know for sure is that it was definitely an accident
hah accidentally
man such slander you're parents should have named you sweeps week
by that i mean to say that you are doing something controversial and exciting in order to get higher ratings i'm likening you to a tv show
we cool
primitivism is the artistic and cultural idea that prehistorical and tribal societies were and are better that modern societies
okay guys whatever
the trouble i have with primitivism is the half assed way it's always evoked it's this simplified idea of primitive cultures where some things get highlighted while a lot of detail gets ignored or obliterated completely all the women were totally topless and all the men wore body paint and hunted with spears life was good in the forest
primitivism has this strange semi positive racism attached to it too
yeah you exaggerate traits as you often do with racism but you make them positive things instead of negative natives were better because they were all stoic and noble and loved mother nature okay great but what if you're native and you're not like that
man you're always screwing those two up
i wonder what it's like being an attractive woman would i be tired of guys coming up and talking to me just because i'm pretty or would i rather find it flattering
no
but i'm not slutty
i would honestly wear a shirt that says that
spring break
zombies everyone loves zombies they are a window onto the other they let us face our fears of society in a way that is accessible and compelling as well as accessibly and compellingly cannibalistic
t rex loves zombies
i think what i love best about them is when they're used to represent mindless behaviour in our own society for example if instead of me we saw a zombie dinosaur stomping on this house then wow suddenly stomping on things is highlighted as maybe something we should think about more are we really acting that thoughtless when we stomp on things thanks for the eye opener dinosaur zombies
yep
when feasible anyway i also really like it when zombies catch someone and tear them apart and the person is all o no zombies my day is ruined
man that's just because it was a convenient example i am still entirely in favour of stomping on things
in other news will the illustrative power of zombies forever be fumbled in my mighty hands
occam's razor is a principle of simplicity it says that one should always choose the simplest explanation for something when given a choice between competing theories of different complexity
anyway yeah
it makes sense
yep as i say it makes sense
indeed
hooray for occam's razor
holy crap is that a pet duck how do you go about getting a pet duck
i must own one
time to go back in time and visit the cradle of civilization
radical
wait dromiceiomimus what are you doing here i was trying to go back in time to visit the cradle of civilization
i can neither confirm nor deny those plans
no maybe i don't know
i just wanted to visit the most recent common ancestor for all of us the woman from whom we are all descended and you know chat her up
my god is that what chat up means
i
my god
i have a new philosophy which is terrible and compelling &#8211 arguably the best kind of philosophy okay so some dudes are stronger and/or smarter than other dudes right
right there are some tough and smart dudes
but none of them are so tough or so smart as to not be afraid of death here we are ignoring sage buddhist dudes who are probably not actually afraid of death so in a state of nature everyone wants to avoid being killed and so will defend themselves when faced with death but since we need resources like food and water to live and they're not infinite we are constantly warring with one another for access to them
everyone is fighting everyone in and endless battle for survival
that's for us to realize that war sucks it makes us die too and so to give up a little of our freedom in exchange for an absolute authority who will ensure internal peace and common defence tada
not exactly this he also says that life in the state of nature was solitary poor nasty brutish and short a compelling phrase unmatched by my poor offering of sage buddhist dudes but i have a better phrase
is it once again time for spooky pubes
here's something that i t rex the talking dinosaur have trouble believing in true love
the problem i have is that so many people claim to have found if but the odds that you'd ever meet that one person and that they'd be available willing and of the right gender and sexual orientation are really pretty small conclusion a lot of people must be faking it
debatable people often talk about finding the one
how's that
hey since when do you come up with such nice analogies for true love
man lucky
being tall in a world designed for average people can be sucky sometimes
on account of the occasional back pain that is
sometimes only when i do the dishes it's just because the counters at my house are designed for norms so i have to bend over to wash things in the sink
 norms is what i call normal people and sets of guys named norm
sure i guess
although i'd rather if we didn't there's a lot of issues and politics around disabilities can deafness be something to be proud of what do you make of strangers who volunteer to push you in your wheelchair and i'd rather not get involved in the debate via my being super tall
hey an audience member has some opinions he'd like to share
me
i'm the audience member
is it possible to imagine something so insanely disgusting that i actually physically throw up is my imagination that powerful
i actually don't think i ever want to find out
dromiceiomimus do you ever approach something new and sort of decide if you want to be really good at it or just a dabbler
yeah i do that sometimes too you know like with painting i don't think i even want to be that good at it i just like my na ve enjoyment of it
just a sec just a sec
okay okay just a sec
aw darn it gross
sociological theory we as a people have lost the big picture worrying more about problems at home than problems that affect us on a planetary scale we have lost a sense of global purpose and i have proof
proof in the form of lyrics from popular music baby
popular music i just said popular music because in the 60s it was all everyone around the world join hands but recently it's all people in the house say 'wayoooh' or whatever we are singularly focused on rooms in houses and have forgotten the rest of the world theory incontestably proven
no way dude
my theory is both funny and accurate and i believe you diss stems from the fact that you're just jealous of how i pick up chicks with my fine fine theories
i told you before their car broke down the chicks were all coming to hang out with me in the same car to save on gas and it broke down that is what happens to cars sometimes
even chicks are subject to entropy man
people probably find sleeping in the fetal position comfortable because it reminds them of the womb
wait i'm a brilliant psychologist all comfort comes from the womb
people find hugs comforting because it reminds them of the tight squeeze of the womb my kisses are popular because they remind people of amniotic fluid in the womb
perhaps but that is a topic for another time
right right
well i think my points are still valid i don't know about you but i do sleep in the egg fetus position
yes they will
i don't want anything bad to happen to my friends i don't want anything bad to happen to people who aren't my friends either but i don't want anything bad to happen to my friends in particular
the odds are that someone i know will be a victim of theft or crime or an accident or even violence and that sucks because there's basically nothing i can do to stop it
you know i don't
oh it's not fear
it's just a preemptive sadness i guess melancholy by melancholy i mean a thoughtful sadness as opposed to the archaic definition a black bile once believed to be excreted by the kidneys
i stomped on people while talking about how sad it is when bad things happen this is an example of dramatic irony
utahraptor you crazy dude what are you doing in my epilogue
i've come up with the best idea ever oh my goodness laundry bags with giant green dollar signs on them hah hah am i robbing a bank in a cartoon or am i doing my laundry
it is difficult to tell
i am indeed or at least i was indeed until i realized that you could just make your own with just a little fabric paint and a working knowledge of what dollar signs looks like
aw man really
i did kinda suspect it might've been done before since it seemed like a really funny idea but i've never seen any such laundry bags i'll just claim to have independently invented them
yes i will be that other dude i will be forever immortalized as a second place finisher in history
wait no that sucks
utahraptor is afraid of ghosts
hah hah hah spoooooky
utahraptor is afraid of ghosts and his favourite song is the gambler by kenny rogers
it's true he also bakes way too many cookies whenever he's baking treats and then when he's done he freezes the extras for later
sure you do
but allow me to distract you with some facts about dromiceiomimus she really likes all kinds of boats and and she's afraid of heights sometimes
yep
i am making life interesting also did you know the devil likes grape juice from concentrate
wouldn't it be totally neat if life was more like a text based adventure game
 you look around and see that the answer is yes
it'd be great because people would have solid goals nobody would be left wondering what to do with their lives
yeah plus we'd have omniscient second person narration
nopers
 take boat
new bike day is when everybody gets new bikes
woo new bike day
and then after we all get the new bikes do you know what happens
what happens is we all receive gold medals for having such nice bikes
now we definitely have to name our bikes
my bike will be called sexual intercourse the bike
guys guys our gold medals are made of solid and delicious chocolate i'm so glad new bike day truly exists here in the real world
let's hear it for reality huh
who here had a series of dreams last night where they were back in school and missing assignments the answer me t rex
it was nuts i never had such a stereotypical dream before i got in an assignment late and was trying to convince the professor to accept it only he didn't want to and kept critiquing my penmanship also the assignment was on pink paper i think it was the only paper i had
what was it
no way no way
professor there must be something i can do to convince you to take this assignment
i know what is the friggin' deal
i had the weirdest dream last night again two nights of memorable dreams in a ro a new personal best
i dreamt i was a cockfighter
no
that was in a dream a dream i never actually punched out a turkey
no i promise to never punch out a turkey
good heavens i have no idea what
i am a dude with a lot of opinions sexy opinions
hells yes
but also all sorts of opinions including the unsexy give me a subject dromiceiomimus and i'll demonstrate
i am for them citrus is insane
well um you must be both prepared and careful and decide for yourself
oh wow
can i do that a website just for my opinions is that seriously allowed
sweet i'm so doing it i'm going home right now and making a website with all my awesome opinions it will revolutionize the internet
oh man
am i doing the right thing with my life what if what i'm doing with my time is actually something i will one day regret what i need is some way to measure regret for every action and career path
done and done
all i'll need to do is ask old people about their lives and measure how many of them regret certain things this regret index will range from 0 no regret to 1 total ultimate regret with it i can tell kids today that if you rub spider eggs into your eyes you're 96% likely to regret it but if you drink delicious lemonade and pop wheelies the regret index on that is near 0
yeah
but regret index makes it sound more scientific i honestly think this could be useful you could find out how many people are still happy that they memorized every star trek episode
i too remain fully satisfied
it all goes in the vault
how come it's not cool to have stories with morals at the end anymore are we too ironic and cool to appreciate a story that you know just straight out tells you what to believe
seriously how come
i liked it when you read a story and you knew that at the end the moral would be spelled out for you in the last sentence so you'd be sure you didn't miss anything does slow and steady win the race can this be clarified in the conclusion somehow
i guess so
yes and we'll have a story off where we write stories and compete with each other
add a love interest
my story has two love interests
i wonder what's the strongest emotion what's the most powerful emotional experience i can look forward to
nobody say love
love isn't allowed because it's too obvious what's the strongest non love emotion dromiceiomimus
okay hate isn't allowed either on account of house it's arguably the opposite of love
a good choice my friend
but are you not forgetting the memorable emotion of hunger
then why do i suddenly feel hungry hmm riddle me that
constant hunger has robbed me of all identity
it's been what four thousand years of civilization five thousand how come we haven't solved all the problems and answered all the questions
i think as a people we have kind of dropped the ball
seriously i can't think of any revolutionary philosophical discoveries like one that would make us all friends that we've come across recently man even democracy was invented in grecian times and we've just fleshed out some of the details since then how come we haven't made any ultimate discoveries of essential truth
true
but the big questions why are we here where are we going these are left open despite lifetimes of work being thrown at them i expect nothing less than total truth and civilization has given me five thousand years of letting me down
man forget this i take back some of the things i said about civilization
i have had a revelation i am wasting my time trying to discover one ultimate essential truth when really i should be looking for essential truths plural
what's true for you might not be true for me dromiceiomimus indeed what's true for me today might not be what's true for me a month from now i accept that there are many ways of living and that all that needs to be discovered is what is right for me as an individual
somewhat to moderately
maybe it's universally true that everyone likes to party
good god what are you cephalopods doing in my bedroom
i have gained provisional access to a shortwave radio last night i was flipping around and discovered a numbers station question how excellent is that
answer totally excellent
if you're unfamiliar with them dromiceiomimus number stations are radio stations that play pre recorded voices reciting long strings of numbers often with a short musical cue beginning or ending the segments they are encoded communication often meant for spies encrypted using one time pads
i know
i love that i live in a world where i can hear actual secret messages for spies
entertaining and affecting and surreal man can you imagine waking up one day and finding that all the radio stations have been replaced by a little girl's voice reading out endless strings of numbers it would be great
and great
it would be like hey i wonder what's on the radio oh it's '39398 32348 59378 70636'
and then the dude would be like it's too awesome my mind is breaking
i have come up with a perfect way not to believe in anything wrong ever again evidentialism
a belief is justified only if there is sufficient evidence to support it
therefore i won't believe in things like faith healing because there's no room for faith in evidentialism i also don't believe there's convincing evidence for anyone having kissed someone so hard that both people exploded so i will have to regretfully concede that i don't believe that's happened yet either but at least i won't believe in anything i can't prove thanks evidentialism
dude it's evidence
a valid attack perhaps strengthened by the old what if we're all just brains in jars question
but what if i switch my beliefs to foundationalism in which i mark a few beliefs as foundations i consider to be self evident
faith and the possibility of weaponized kissing
the worst part of owning a cape is having to find excuses to wear it
luckily i am just the dude to manufacture such excuses i have the perfect plan since it sucks to be the only dude in the room wearing a cape i will simply start telling people that existing holidays are now cape wearing holidays like thanksgiving
yes it is now a day to give thanks and wear stylish outmoded fashions
aw damn
but you forgot to wear it too utahraptor
well i certainly hope you'll change your mind for vampire day next week i'm definitely not forgetting my cape for that
aw damn
pantheism is the belief that everything the entire universe is literally god
like i said the universe and god are the exact same thing
we all get to be divine dromiceiomimus better everything i do is an act of god right now this aspect of god wants to stomp on this other more housey aspect of god
i see it more like every tasty thing in the universe is god and i'm getting hungry
perhaps
but perhaps by making everything special by spreading that divinity around a bit so that everyone gets a piece we'll all see our world as the extraordinary place it is
dude it's not like you can't just make your own
the sexiest job competition is tasked with finding out who has the sexiest job we must begin
congratulations self you are our leading candidate
you do a profoundly unpopular job i am sorry to announce that yours is the least sexy job thus far
i'd do anyone who has their own website
i respect how you've made a career out of it yet it's still gross
there's one way to find out
hey hey dude toenail dude
how do you get paid
attention men are you a man here are some tips
tip 1 grooming is important
 this means that you have to shower and if you always wake up with food on your face then you have to understand that you have a problem we all have problems but yours is that you go to sleep beside bowls of wet salad and then in your sleep you tip over the bowl you need to work on that i don't know what to tell you
tip 2 prostate exams apparently important
tip 3 in some situtations like truck stops manliness is measured by virility so you may wish to boast of sexual conquests but in other situations job interviews it's measured by problem solving skills and your ability to work in groups
attention women sometimes men fall asleep next to bowls of wet salad i don't know what to tell you
i have a friend who was hit with a 40 pound log on the head she might have a concussion
what's the deal with that
what's the deal logs
yeah she's fine
she might have a concussion but yeah still i blame logs
she was at a log stacking show and this one chick totally sucked at stacking logs basically
man my grandmother could stack logs better than you
what are you gonna do accidentally bean a friend of mine with a log and then feel powerfully guilty about it
i think that comedy goes bad after a while i don't think i've ever laughed at a joke that's more than two hundred years old
screw you comedy
it's not just that jokes get dated but that whole standards for comedy shift i think stuff that was edgy fifty years ago is old hat today we can recognize how it was supposed to be funny but there's comedic writing from a hundred years ago that goes right over our heads today simply because we don't have the cultural context to recognize that jokes are being made that parody and satire are taking place ouch for those guys ouch for us in 200 years
i guess
but i think comedy changes more than most we can read serious writing from centuries ago and the arguments are way more accessible than any jokes
oh man i never told you one time i saw a stupid guy nobody likes eating too many bananas
'cause he was dumb
dumb for bananas
okay so perhaps there are those who find old jokes in old books to be hilarious and we just happen to have different senses of humour it may have been a mistake to generalize across every living thing that can laugh and also read
this i do concede
but i still think that it's true that given a random joke from the present and one from the past the average person will be more likely to laugh at the present joke just because they have more context i'm convinced present day jokes about airplane food will fade in cultural relevance and become less funny as airplanes are replaced by hoverpants
ah you refer to my classy search for a middle ground
hee it's true it's the same argument but since the future doesn't exist yet nobody can really argue with me about it one way or the other
the hell what was i saying about us not existing
i would have words with past t rex that dude has a lot of stale friggin' opinions
man what is the deal with triflin' friends indeed
they appear to reliably take my money when i'm in need
dromiceiomimus here's a crazy question would you say that you are a triflin' friend indeed
i don't know &#8212 are you sure you're not possibly triflin'
i am in love with this song
the gold digger one it's about a woman who is a gold digger and then the narrator suggests to her that maybe she's a gold digger
then she takes the narrator's money when he's in need
what's this a radio
what if this is the high point of my life what if it's all downhill from here that sucks
for me
i kind of hoped i might go a bit further than this in life but then again maybe not it's entirely possible that this right here is as far as i go in 10 years i could be that guy who is way too nostalgic for the past remember how great it was before i screwed up my life guys that'll be me
i'll be that guy
i could be too tired from the weight of a life squandered to stomp on even the smallest of log cabins and women
i don't think so either really but maybe guys who peaked in high school thought this too then they made some bad decisions
people who've made bad decisions i salute you
hooray for visiting old friends
old friends are the best kind of friends because you still get along really well even though you maybe haven't seen each other for a long time it is a time for healthy nostalgia and for talking of tomorrow
yes my endorsement of old friends is not meant to be taken as a slight against friends currently in rotation
an excellent question
i think what i like best is how you have the intimacy years of friendship provides but also the perspective gained from any time spent apart it lets you be honest with each other you can see how everyone's changed and talk and laugh about it
aww well i'll be their friend unless there's a good reason why they don't have any friends such as rampant murderism or incurable stealie o holicism
then we're set
how many emotions are there i can think of at least three
desire elation and rage
yep it's about a woman who desires something then gets it and is pretty elated about the whole thing but then afterwards she's pretty pissed
i find your views interesting tell me more
breakfast pleasure finally i have words for that most sublime of satisfactions breakfast pleasure i love breakfast pleasure
i'm not entirely certain that you do
has this strapping young dinosaur perhaps become a little complacent
it's time to go traveling
this is because travel beats complacency if you do it right when you're traveling as a backpacker outside of the regular tourism industry you're off the beaten path and doing a lot of new things all on your own you meet new people and since you're put in an environment where you're probably less comfortable than you usually are both literally and figuratively you're in a prime situation for self discovery as well
absolutely
but i mean i know it's not entirely a positive thing all tourism can change the areas it touches my role as a backpacker could be seen as an advance scout for the larger tourism industry and if i find something wonderful odds are others will soon follow
i don't know man stop traveling encase unspoiled areas in amber use spaceships to colonize new planets and therefore delay the issue until there are no new frontiers
that's cause it's got rockets
hey hey utahraptor do do you think that some guys go to liquor stores to pick up chicks because they know everyone there is over 18
or at least
 willing to pretend
dromiceiomimus what are you doing here i thought it was just the guys
disaster
so personally dromiceiomimus i feel that
whoah utahraptor i thought that dromiceiomimus was behind me
no no i wasn't
incidentally i don't have any friends who aren't gendered
man forget television books films short films to a lesser extent plays and other theatre and the remaining popular media they have cheapened emotion by putting it on constant display
this i do believe
maybe cheapened is too strong a word but it's now routine predictable now if we've made a big mistake we can't say my god what have i done because it's too clich we either have to acknowledge that or reach for another way to express it in conclusion and in summary the highest experience life can offer us have already been acted out for us cheapened by imitation and reference instead of experienced firsthand
sometimes especially when i get angry
it's just that it can be hard to have a meaningful conversation when you're dancing around all these clich s
aww that is me i talk as if nobody's listening i dance as if nobody's watching and i eat as if nobody's hungry
i also vacuum as if nobody's going to get their carpets any cleaner
daaaamn
i am writing the best story ever in it i simply appropriate a popular novel and then place its author in a generalized version of its premise then the author has eerily familiar but thoroughly modernized adventures
so it's like h g wells actually has a time machine that he uses for wacky escapades
and then he goes back in time to meet edgar allan poe who actually is haunted by the supernatural and has a creepy raven in his study next to the silken sad uncertain rustling of his purple curtains after picking up mary shelley they all go forward in time and meet patricia highsmith who is surrounded by morally compromised antihero neighbours then they all go on a train ride and have an adventure
then my friend the story writes itself
and at the end all the characters high five each other and go home to their own times promising to write their own versions of what happened then they all write their most famous works
edgar allan poe what are you doing here
awesome i like how you rhyme
edgar allan poe i have things to do today we can't hang out the entire time
edgar allan poe you are so needy
edgar we're spending time together right now that counts it has to count if you follow me around
that's because he is
hey here's a fun fact for you edgar allan poe has access to a time machine and all he wants to do is talk about our relationship
i'm fine with that hello poe
i'm sorry i snapped at you edgar allan poe
can you can you keep this out of your famous and memorable poems do you think
today is a good day i think for keeping all my wicked sweet opinions to myself i will keep my own counsel
 gasp
that's because i am
i am keeping all my awesome rad opinions to myself today
things were just going that way but who knows what tomorrow will bring for me t rex
today is a good day i think for eating hobosnacks hobosnacks are snacks for hobos i think they're commercially marketed as cheetos
indeed
i am pretty sure that i could be a pretty great soccer player if i really tried to be i just haven't explored it it's probably one of my many
i'm probably also really good at surfing stand up comedy cross stitching and helicopter theft i just haven't tried them because i prefer believing that i have secret talents the world hasn't seen to knowing for certain that i don't actually have anything special and secret in me waiting to be accessed
precisely
i'm so awesome at stealing copters but i wonder if i could ever be good at stomping on things
is this finally a conundrum that can't be solved with helicopter theft
gosh am i the ultimate friend i am supportive and a good listener i do favours and care and keep track of everything that's going on in my friends' lives
t rex the ultimate friend
aha my friend but once again i said the ultimate friend not the utimate pushover but i'll still do your dishes sometimes if i'm there
easy
your eyes are a distinctive shade of icy blue
piercing orange
a chartreusey shade of puce
today i am going to try to be a better friend i will tell secrets as secrets are one of the many currencies of friendship i will also listen to what my friends have to say and then make helpful comments that solve every one of their problems
every
single
one
i um wow
wow pregnancy
and it's such a personal thing too people get upset when you tell them you think they're dating the wrong person how do you tell them that you think they're creting life with the wrong person
or maybe the answer is you get a ghose to show them your dystopian vision of their future do you know any ghosts
i wonder what's the craziest way to spell crazy
my suggestion k ray z
that's totally crazy
that's why i like it
eh too crazy
that's inaccessibly crazy which is its own beast all together
learn to tango
eat a whole bag of plums
buy a whole bag of plums and then eat the plums and then blame a passing dog for the resulting plummy mess
i've got my own problems
aw man i've got my own problems
hey me too
he was wearing one of those umbrella hats so maybe
i've got my own problems
i have come up with the worst idea aver and it's so simple all you have to do is combine online gambling with online role playing games
the result will be a game to ruin lives
mmorpgs are already really popular and addictive some people play them upwards of eight hours a day throw in a casino where you can not only win real money but also rare in game items and experience points and you've merged two addictions into one feeding them into each other it'll be a terribly effective way to make profits from those with addictive personalities
yep
you'd allow bets like that but balance it so overall you don't end up losing real money the more you gamble the better stats your characters get and the more you play the more chances you have to win in the casino both addictions encourage the other
oh i've got other awful ideas too like a toy gun for children but every one in twenty shots on average it actually fires a real bullet
that's a horrific idea
what is wrong with me

that's a horrific idea
what is wrong with me
i know all sorts of things women love for example women love it when you dismiss them in arguments by saying whoah this kitten's got claws
no way dude
it's hilarious it's ironic because i've never actually called a woman a kitten on account of how i'm not a facial hair dude from the seventies and it also says i understand you're upset but not really upset because i'm willing to make a joke that's sort of at your expense but also really at my expense too because now i look like a sexist facial hair dude let's share a laugh
there are layers upon layers
yep but it's not sincere sexism i wouldn't say whoah this cute somehow inferior gender's got claws
probably it's never happened
i wanna see
i love punch i love drinking delicious punch probably because of how it's so delicious
hooray for punch
quite likely i don't know why i'm suddenly so into what is essentially juice mixed with maybe pop or alcohol served in a fancy bowl with spoons but i'm running with it
oh god yes
man this party even has a stomping room i'm totally going to get some punch soon
dude i'm gonna i'm gonna go and get in line for some punch right now
is this the punch line
so you're saying there is no punch line
one time i snuck onto a friend's computer while at his house and altered an essay he was writing for school about evil all i did for instant hilarity was relace every instance of the word evil with the phrase irish evil
can good exist without irish evil some philosophers suspect it cannot
i know that's part of the joke how the author seems so obsessed with examining every aspect of his ridiculous concept of irish evil
and i am only too happy to provide them
to see for yourself all you have to do is go to the wikipedia article on evil and do the replaces there hah hah my comedy once again trumps the desires of those who would seek useful information about evil
it's very nice to meet you jimbo wales founder and president of wikipedia
wow jimbo wales
are you a person who uses phrases at incorrect times
i hope that will not be the case today with
after what happened to me last week i will now wash my hands frequently i mean i mean more frequently
okay
so kant's categorical imperative is more of a meta directive right
i love you
i wonder what the most important day of my life is yesterday tomorrow maybe even
today
it could be that i wouldn't even recognize the importance of the day until years down the line like if today is the day i come across an abandoned violin and ten later i discover that i'm actually seriously excellent at playing sonatas and then i become famous for playing sonatas that would have a huge effect on my life and today could be that day
aw man
if that is the case then i would be sorely disappointed i'm serious i would be so disappointed that i would start to get physically sore
hello my name is t rex i'm pleased to meet you
hey god would the world be an even awesomer place if everyone named benjamin instead went by the name ben jammin'
see that's what i keep telling everyone
i'm so glad i was right on this one
nope i knew one when i was a kid but he moved away way before i ever found out about jammin' that was in what grade 5
well last i heard he was starting high school a few towns over so i presume he went through the development process that is high school and emerged a changed taller man than the person i remember from our halcyon pre pubescent days
another case closed
and by that i mean that was my first experience with losing a friend
what should i do if i see someone littering every time i do something different and every time it feels like the wrong thing to do
i've tried doing nothing but that left me feeling like a frustrated milquetoast pushover i keep wanting to pull the excuse me you dropped this line but it is sort of an aggressive thing to do especially if the way i say it makes it clear i think it was indeed no accident i could see that leading to a confrontation and i don't want to be that guy who throws punches over empty cans of coke
but it's an overreaction isn't it
i don't know littering's this perfectly situated thing where it's not that big a deal taken individually but a really antisocial thing when taken on a larger scale
exaclty i don't know how i should react when confronted with a small instance of a small crime but which still bothers me all i can think of is to sneak poo bugs into the dude's food
you take that back
one of the things i've imagined ever since i was a little kid was how neat it would be if you could sort your life by events and view that instead
you could see every time you eat delicious sandwiches organized chronologically
wouldn't that be cool dromiceiomimus i think that would be cool you could peek ahead and see every time you get into a fight so you could be prepared
true but you'd also be able to see a rapid fire montage of all the women you ever kiss that would be neat and hopefully not disappointing
i know
it might be awkward getting camera permission just before i kiss her but i'm up to the task
you know what's even hotter than kissing someone for the first time
baby it's like you read my mind
a loaded question is when you ask a question that presupposes something unproven
for instance dromiceiomimus i could ask hey dromiceiomimus are you still punching children
aha so when did you stop see what i did there the question presupposes that you've been punching on children in the past and goes on to suggest that maybe you're still doing so it is loaded like rich uncle pennybags from monopoly
yep
it breaks down to have you ever punched children and if so are you still doing so but since these are merged and since this merged form still demands a yes or no answer no becomes misleading the solution is not to answer yes or no but to reject the question
i reject your question utahraptor it's loaded
okay you must never enter politics ever
am i perhaps too comfortable too satisfied with my life and friends and routine has the warm embrace of satisfaction become the smothering kiss of complacency
it's time to shake things up t rex style
dromiceiomimus here's a compelling idea for ending complacency we'll insult each other and then become enemies and then i wouldn't have our little chats to look forward to anymore result complacency nullified
you're so lame
sucky to the max
i've been systematically destroying the life i knew but that's just left me panicky and unsatisfied my romance for something new has led to a realization that i had a routine because i liked what i was doing and when i was doing it
yes i will apologize to dromiceiomimus and if i ever get too comfortable again well i could probably get used to the smothering kiss of complacency and maybe one day i'll finally be ready to start kissing back
hey everyone stop saying bitches so much
there are other words than bitches daaamn
these words include such fine examples as fellows gravy and monterey jack
exclusively for example instead of saying hey get off my back bitches i can now say hey get off my back monterey jack
says you gravy
i do want gravy
i've allowed my love of gravy to distract from my prescriptivist linguistic crusade
 seriously does that mean i get into heaven for free
who spent their tuesday night doing the best thing possible the answer me
i built a statue of myself
it's larger than life and looks just like me only bigger what i'm trying to say dromiceiomimus is that it's fantastic and you should see it some time soon
well maybe but a statue is still awesome
but i built a whole statue overnight
although on closer inspection i must concede that building a fully functional t rex robot overnight would have been pretty darned choice
shoot
hah bawdy image issues
well actually no but i do empathise i really like being a giant awesome dinosaur but nobody's ever told me that being giant and awesome is undesirable i guess sometimes i've been frustrated by my stubby arms but i still love the li'l champs
nope
i guess i'm lucky i can't imagine what it must be like to be trans sexual waking up in the morning and feeling like there's been some unfair mistake and parts of your body are wrong
the devil does that answer your question
i think that i have a few friends super friends if you will that i'll keep in touch with no matter what happens and they with me it comforts me to think this
dromiceiomimus you are one such super friend i can see us getting together years from now after we all drift apart and still being able to pick up from where we left off we'd email once or twice a year and that would be all it would take to maintain our super friendship
and you're one of mine of course
sweet we're all friends and super friends at that which i guess really just goes to show you that you don't need conflict to drive a narrative
the narrative of life
where are the knockers
i saw a totally sweet ad yesterday i wanted to show it to my friends but then i realized that's exactly what the marketers wanted me to do who here doesn't want to be a tool of viral marketers
the answer me
when i was a kid it was okay because i didn't have any cultural context and didn't understand that maybe companies wanted me to spread the word about their ads but now that i'm a grown up target market dude i know that companies sometimes design ads with the express intent that i'll get excited and tell my friends and it turns out i don't really like being manipulated for profit by strangers
i don't know dude
i know i don't want to give up on getting excited about cool ads art can be created in a commercial context and i don't want to reject something because of its origins but i don't want to be captain suggestible either
i'm sorry cap'n you forgive me so hard
 aw i feel kinda bad about taking advantage of captain suggestible what do you do with someone who is that damn suggestible
 dude has his own problems
 it reminds me of this friend i had in high school who could never ever detect sarcasm no matter what it's such a small thing but it would come up all the time when i'd be like oh no please no more ketchup and then i wouldn't get any more ketchup when i actually wanted some more ketchup
 we were crazy dudes in high school
 maybe mostly i see elements of myself
 he's just got this big interpersonal thing where he's not quite sure what's appropriate and because of that he transgresses unwritten societal boundaries all the time i think we've all done that a little and it's embarrassing
 everyone observe my beach nudity
 this is no accident
hello world i have the following announcements to make
the first announcement is that i am awesome
the second announcement is that everyone within the sound of my voice is awesome
the third announcement is that i need to borrow fifty dollars
yes good sir who will lend me the money someone awesome perhaps
but wouldn't you rather i owe you one hundred and thirty dollars
god give me fifty dollars
jack sprat could eat no fat
and they shared eating disorders
what a world
what
dude that's not funny
that is accurate and sobering
wait a minute i recognize these
utahraptor
did you find my long abandoned copy of encryption jokes for teens
there is a lawyer dude who has plastered the city's telephone poles and bus shelters with ads proclaiming quick divorce $300 and there's always about 2 or 3 of the little phone numbers from the bottom taken
ouch for modern marriages
i took one but that was simply because i saw the hilarious prank possibilities of leaving one in a married friend's wallet but then i had an even better idea next to each of his divorce fliers i put up my own that say quick marital bliss $295 95 hah hah it is public space art and it also makes bus shelters less depressingly pro quick divorce
what
i um i hadn't thought of that i was too impressed with having an actual good idea for an art project to think about consequences
hah hah
how perfectly profitable
time for me to learn some new languages as the old saying goes he who can speak many languages is suspected by his peers to be an ultra super genius times two
perhaps i will learn sigh language
you know sign language
neat
then it's settled i will learn sign language
dude maybe we're trendsetters maybe in three months languages less spoken will the the very currency of coolness a shibboleth for entry into the rarefied world of ultra popularity
my question what could be cooler than that
i have a friend who has a problem and that problem is that she is one of many with
this woman in particular wants nothing more than to fall in love with a beautiful and wonderful man get married and have children the only career she wants is the noble career of raising a child right but some of her friends question her for not wanting anything more out of life they don't see being a wife and mother is enough aaand they kinda think she's wasting her education
hell yes
i could work on my own projects and cook delicious meals and i could make bad decisions all day long
and raise children
i may well be the perfect mate don't you think
if i were you i'd tell my friends about me
i am a dude who came across a suitcase full of old love letters i got in high school sweet
that's right ladies i've got a history
i'd completely forgotten about these letters and it was really cool to re read them now with older less hormonally charged eyes we were crazy kids struggling with feelings we didn't fully understand it was charming also and i um i don't pretend to understand this but there's one letter from each girlfriend where without exception she's drawn the two of us she and i as batman and the joker
i refuse to say
but i assure you that for whatever reason each of them saw it fit to render a copyright infringing vision of a universe where we live the astonishing dreams of finger and kane
man i think that's pretty obvious
everyone i've ever kissed is awesome
so yeah as i was saying the relativist fallacy is when you reject a claim by saying oh that may be true for you but it's not true for me
so if i say the atomic mass of xenon is 131 3 amu a response of oh maybe it is for you is a fallacy but if i said toast is the ultimate breakfast time treat you could very well respond with maybe for you not for me and it wouldn't be a fallacy because as we know the debate over breakfast is as subjective as it is eternal
oh just god
he was asking me what the weight of xenon was and i was all duh 131 3 amu and he was all duh maybe for you t rex and i was all aha time to pontificate then i worked in an example about toast
it all comes back to toast
having a shower is like admitting you get dirty
and and going to the bathroom is like admitting you need to go to the bathroom sometimes going to bed is like admitting you get tired eating is like admitting you get hungry being a cannibal is like admitting you don't throw in with the laws of god and man
that's it
utahraptor says i don't
they make truth serum but how come they don't make lie serum
i could take some go out and cause problems
you could even overdose on lie serum and never tell the truth again until you got an injection of truth serum to cancel it out
how can you trust a medical science that won't share the amazing secret of lie serum also known as the serum of lies and more obliquely as the serum of inducing distrustfulness in others
how's that
anyway have some of this serum i just invented
no it tastes like delicious blueberry
i'm not sure if i'll ever be married and have kids there's just so much that has to happen first i have to meet a woman fall in love she has to fall in love with me
then we have to engage in successful sexual congress producing offspring
i'd love to be a father i think but i'll probably just end up as that crazy uncle who comes to visit and secretly teaches everybody else's kids how to put too many bananas in their mouth ah well it's a good life if you don't weaken
thank you dromiceiomimus
that is technically true
however would i even know if that results in kids do they tell the donor that honestly all i know about sperm banks comes from teen gross out comedies
yes i suspect that without fail somebody always accidentally consumes the semen
i suspect that sperm banks have put processes in place to prevent this but that it continues to occur i suspect that managers are going grey from constantly dealing with reports of accidental semen consumption they've tried everything but guests and staff seem almost intent on consuming it
hmm what's the biggest mistake i've ever made i wonder
more broccoli please
oh whatever that wasn't even a mistake i've got to tally up a lifetime of failings and concentrate harder than ever before i will stomp on things to focus my mental energies or menergies
hmm
hah hah
no way
hah hah hah
what
here is a terrible idea for a date you take the lady to a stinky old sewage processing plant and then tour the facilities you could be all sorry potential lifemate i'm a dude who makes bad date decisions
huh i don't know dromiceiomimus
oh yeah
neat
wow you are one appreciative date and you are one surprisingly amorous tour guide
aw snapadoodle
so then i just gave her a new bill it was a little embarrassing but my real problem is what to do with this fiver now that i know it's a fake
exactly and brining it to a bank just means i'm out $5 they wouldn't exchange it for a real bill because then the counterfeiters could just go to the banks too
aw poo
man you know where i got the fake money change from a friggin' fast food restaurant
i blame the colonel sanders
well good
it's controversy monday
controversy monday is the day when you needlessly volunteer made up opinions on abortion
can we accept that there will always be some unstable people who will go off with any stimulus and that others can't be held responsible
yes they're crazy
true but that's ridiculous that's like saying that if your parents had conceived differently you wouldn't have been born
 thereby making them responsible for the fact that you came over last night and ate all my damn pastries
you were just preparing for your belly swelling with my so delicious pastries
i'm not a dude who usually has dreams but last night i dreamed i had a whole other house had forgotten about paying the mortgage and was now horribly in debt
thanks subconscious
not only did i get to have fabricated money woes but i also got to wake up with the same dream feeling of aw snap i'm in trouble now in real life too woo
exactly sucks to that
perhaps literally
maybe i really have made tons of mistakes in my real life as a butterfly and then i go to sleep and dream i'm this awesome dinosaur with friends then i wake up and i'm still this indebted sucky butterfly with bad fiscal management skills
man i'm a butterfly saddled with crippling debt there's nothing cute about that
granted
here are some professions whose female members i could never marry because i&#8217 d be such an uncontrollably bad husband to them
first dentists
i respect what they do but i&#8217 m sorry lady oral hygiene professionals i can&#8217 t brush and floss three times a day plus after every snack drink or intense fantasy about food i have tried and failed also i couldn&#8217 t marry a professional housecleaner because she&#8217 d soon suspect that i&#8217 m obsessed with trying to undermine all that she&#8217 s striving for with my every discarded sock and unwashed dish
oh yeah
that&#8217 s because i choose the universe that i want to live in
i also believe all conflicts are solvable through communication peace is attainable and that love is a gift that cannot be commodified
then i mourn the death of childhood and my final loss of innocence duh
i am enamoured with writing things in cheque memo fields it is a rare chance for comedy in the otherwise staid world of financial services and automated cheque processing
i have always been a fan of writing stop following me just because i love the idea of a guy who is being followed by someone and then gets so pissed off that he spins around whips out his chequebook and cuts the dude a cheque then and there just to make him go somewhere else
also gold especially if it's a cheque for like 37 cents
apparently not dude
although i have written things like nudity tax when i didn't want the person to cash the cheque
too easy man seriously you should join us in our wacky cheque world it's great
 the exact value of a broken heart
hah hilarious
i have another plan for immortality
this time for sure
i will be remembered in the cultural zeitgeist and this time i won&#8217 t even have to do anything memorable i will simply become famous by virtue of being famous i will construct a synthetic celebrity and i will reap the benefits
i am hoping to be remembered as &#8220 the dude with the confusing allure&#8221
huh
oh i must have explained it poorly i&#8217 ll just act like i&#8217 m famous you know get people to react to me like i&#8217 m famous and then kapow we have critical mass for actual fame
you guess correctly
aw come on you&#8217 re not even punctuating it properly
the uncanny valley is the name given to the idea that as we build robots that look more and more like real people the more we approach a point where we all say oh god oh god what is wrong with that robot where did it all go wrong oh god
this also applies to animation
the idea is that crudely realized characters don't look like real people but we can see some qualities of real people in them so they're cute but as you add more and more realism without quite reaching perfection you reach a point where suddenly instead of cartoons that look real they're real people who look terribly wrong cuteness is replaced with the same reaction we'd have to putrid retching animated corpse revulsion and question is why
hence the valley you accept the creature more and more then are suddenly repulsed then you accept it the most
hah i don't think i love the way you do
there my costume looks like a failed corpse that still makes a blasphemous claim to life thanks uncanny valley
it's so upsetting that you got personified uncanny valley
yes this is a topic i know all about
okay the first way is to draw attention to your hips
this is because women have larger more flared hips than men do on account of secondary sexual characteristics so all heterosexual men cannot help but find women's hips utterly fascinating and all heterosexual women find men's hips flabbergastingly erotic
perhaps that is because you have a case of the perversions
the second way is to draw attention to your skull
nope skull men have heavier skulls than women so again men find light skulls unbelievably sexy and women find heavy skulls astonishingly gorgeous
utahraptor searching for internet fetish pornography has robbed me of any erotic desires i may have once had
in one sentence starting with dude
dude road trips rule
what's special about them is that it's a time when you and your friends can sit together in single place for literally hours and chat but protracted silences don't need to be filled you can just look out the windows or nap if you were all in a blank room somewhere it would be weird to just sit there but the ever changing scenery in a car provides a distraction that is both welcome and easy to interrupt there's nothing like it
yes i agree
i move that we trip to brazil
the island continent of australia
okay but utahraptor what's that across the street a car that works on water
dudes are you in need of inspiration
then dudes come on it's time to get inspired
sunsets can be inspiring in you are a sensitive dude or a super weepy dude
yes solar scientist dudes are scientifically nature's most inspired dudes
hah whatevs
i love eating cheeseburger
sometimes it's inspiring
i don't understand how people could have seriously thought that the world was flat
did they have a case of the crazies
did they
because if you accept that the world is a finite plane then it's got limits and what's at the edge of those limits
a vertical wall that goes down a few kilometres and then what
tree roots
upside down land
a place where owls rule the world like they don't even care
really
utahraptor had made an excellent point
i felt embarrassed and soon found myself imagining different conversations i could've had instead
it was good times
man time for me to grow some friggin' facial hair
yes
this is one situation where men have the clear gender advantage
yep sure women get to feel the miracle of life growing inside them and the joy of birth or of laying eggs or whatever but we get to engineer hairy faces at our leisure
the way you say it is there actually an organization called beards over babies
dude we have to start it
our logo can be a big ol' beard hovering over a truly startled baby
the turing test is a test that all emergent intelligences face at one point or another
in it you have a real person engaged in a text conversation with both a person and a machine and that person has to determine which responder is which if the machine can appear more alive than the person then they pass
nope the problem is that the test doesn't prove consciousness just communication and um it can be faked
hells yes
since conversations don't last forever then there's a finite number of sentences that make sense and that are at least passibly grammatical so you can just record every possible response to every possible word combination and kapow responses like a real person
what's lame we've just totally faked out the turing test and all it required was near infinite storage space brute force the approach of kings and the king of approaches
tell me more about disagree
oh man am i ever sick me i never get sick but this time i've gotten sick
my mighty body lies in shambles
oh dromiceiomimus you've got to save me failing that tell them my story regale future generations with stories of mighty t rex felled by nothing greater than the common cold irony will be my theme stomping my leitmotif
oh and a headache too this is how my story ends not in a bang but a sniffle for shame
dromiceiomimus is apparently unwilling so yes
aw dude you're imagining it right now
i represent heidegger watch as i stomp on the little guy who's just trying to understand my seemingly purposely obscure philosophical writing
you said it everyone
do you get to write your own epitaph if you do then mine will seriously be here lies t rex the radical dude with the radical 'tude or even t rex smart and trim let's be like him
that's neat you could cheat and have 1920s title cards dudes forsooth i'm so dead but just silent images would also be cool what would you have
hmm i guess i'd have a picture of me giving a thumbs up
you didn't let me finish then over me and my thumbs up a newspaper spins toward the camera 1930s style fills the frame and the headline says t rex awesome dead
okay let me think
alright yours would be a video of a soggy dog and then the dog throws up a little and then there's a subtitle that says bad decisions
that's tough yet fair
later
compadres i bid you each adieu
it's not goodbye just &#8211 farewell this isn't the end dromiceiomimus but merely the end of an era one door closes as another opens and we can't forever live in the past a new brighter light beckons
hasta la vista tiny woman
oh my god me too
i'll always love you
denied
today is the day we talk about meritocracy
in a meritocracy all jobs including government jobs are assigned based on merit so if you're the best at a job then it's yours regardless of your sex or gender or race or stupid mustachio or anything
then you wouldn't actually be the best you'd get some other job you're better at the result pure uncut utopia
sure there is
god can you be an omniscient and impartial third party for me
i have actually it's a film theory
the idea is that the camera is situated by and for men
thus we always see more of the woman's body than we do of the man's in film the camera possesses the heterosexual male gaze and thereby disenfranchises the woman by reducing her to the passive object of gaze while the male is elevated to the active gazer it is a not uncontroversial theory
 but what about that as applied to video games
wow i never thought you'd be interested in this male gazey stuff
the devil i thought he was more interested in you know wall haxx than in sexual power structures societally encoded into the cinematic gaze the added wrinkle of increased agency in games makes it extra interesting
laura mulvey
okay okay time to solve all the problems
buy more salt it's free from the ocean
um i don't know how to solve this problem
i guess but what about the child
lay off the crackers
hooray more crackers for everyone
whatever there are still like a billion problems left we haven't even touched on my problem yet
utahraptor it's too much poo
okay dudes and lesbians getting a woman to like you is easy
there are plenty of websites magazine articles and body spray ads that will reassure you that women are just conquests without agency and that they won't have sex with you unless you suggest it to them first my advice is different my advice is rooted in reality and allows for women actually wanting the intercourse sometimes
the advice
well for that you'll have to buy my book dudes lesbians guess what here is how to get women to like you but since we're friends i'll give you a sneak peek
chapter 3 at the bar there are sometimes lots of women at the bar if you want to talk to one then maybe she will want to talk to you then you can become her favourite dude or lesbian
okay heterosexual chicks and totally gay dudes getting a man to like you is trivial
have you tried sexing him up
hee hee
what's terrible i'm just propogating the stereotype that all men want is sex and that if you want to attract one then you should have sex with him as soon as possible and he'll be yours for as long as you keep trading sex for intimac
wait that is terrible
attention all heterosexual chicks and gay dudes don't listen to me
seriously
i suggest telling them that you're asexual
problem solved
the end
explain
fine asexual people you should do what i do when i want someone not to like me anymore

i have received complaints apparently i use too many exclamation marks apparently i am too excitable well not anymore today is a day of level headedness
starting right now
so how are you dromiceiomimus
that's good i'm fine too do i seem level headed to you i's because i am not exclaiming anything i am calm and reserved you might be reaching for a word that word is unflappable
complaints
i got a letter from an anonymous dude and he said i exclaimed too much so here we are
i will only start exclaiming again if i see something surprising
sure haven't
i have a friend who got an email invitation to a sex party someone here did not recieve a corresponding invitation
that person is me
not that i want to go to a sex party but i had no idea you could get invited to them over email and um also that they actually existed
now that you mention it yes i will
i don't know
it was hidden so as to keep things discreet it's kind of funny because who knows who you'll run into old girlfriends bosses the postman there's a danger in going to a sex party
good to know
what if i offended someone sexy
determinism is the idea that every event and thought ever is predetermined this determination is not done by fate or god or whatever but rather by an almost endless chain of prior events causality is king
also there's also no such thing as a random event
a nice benefit of this is that free will is reduced to a complete illusion since everything anyone ever does is already decided on the plus side this means that you can decide to do anything you want because you're not responsible for it but on the minus side it means that you can't ever actually decide to do anything thank determinism
true
but you'd just be lying to yourself you're affecting events but not choosing anything
hooray you pass determinism
when you break up with someone can you still be friends
sources say yep sure can
i think it's a good idea because you loved them right i don't see that changing just because you broke up they still must be pretty great
okay but there still must be things that attracted you to them and you can still have those as friends maybe they're really good at karaoke or adept at shoe repair that's attractive
that's what i'm saying
okay honestly i did not expect this to be this complicated all my breakups have been clean and totally awesome
that's cool
dromiceiomimus i have a great idea for our act let's put on a play
a batman play
it's a play about batman i'll play batman
but i'll be playing batman
okay fine we'll do plan omega upon closer inspection i can see myself really getting into plan omega
hi we're t rex and utahraptor and we'll be performing push it by salt n pepa in the original french
poussez le bon
so there's this guy i know and he must be a friend of a friend because i see him sometimes at parties but we can never be friends because i find looking at him intensely frustrating he has the world's most punchable face
and it's terrible it reflects poorly on me i know but there's just something about him that is bad for me it's like being sexually attracted in reverse i just end up avoiding the guy he's got a stupid face for jerks
 sigh
i guess i just can't get past my prejudice against people with stupid faces for jerks
really
i know it's the same with me my only consolation is that somebody else probably thinks i t rex have a stupid face so at least i'll get my prejudice from both sides
this somehow validates my own prejudice mysterious stranger across the street
what a lovely day for a walk i enjoy crisp fall air and the changing colour of the leaves
ladies and gentlemen i am down with fall
okay because if you're down with fall then you're down with me
excellent then we're all down with fall
excellent
then i guess i guess to summarize here we're all in favour of fall we're all down with it
good good
utahraptor can i borrow your time reversing ray real quick
dude i wanna aim it at the left half of my face and cause problems
attention world who wants to come over and help me celebrate
 superman's birthday
sure am while superman may be fictional the cake and good times will be super real
excellent it will be super good times
sure can
and i assure you it will be super excellent
hah hah we'll see about that
i drank too much
i have the best idea ever for a series of books oh man i'll be rich and famous
two words
shakespeare prequels
cha ching it's great because everyone loves shakespeare and also finding out what characters were up to before they got interesting it'll be hamlet only he's happy and well adjusted walking around saying i certainly hope my father doesn't get murdered indeed and then ophelia says that's right baby i incidentally plan to remain sane and then there's irony shakespeare fans love irony
no way dude
it's all the famous plays all's well that begins well prince lear romeo and juliet babies that one's romeo and juliet only they're tiny and smelly
i know
 for never was a story of more woe
star cross'd babies
woo hallowe'en i love hallowe'en because i love dressing up
i also love looking at people who are dressed up it's on account of how costumes are awesome
it's true the only nurse costumes for sale are from sexy hospital md
they're that sexy
that is true
though i suppose in our haste to deconstruct the societal sexual roles and fantasies made tangible through the mass production of gendered costumes we're forgetting about genderless costumes like giant ape suits
really where
hott
i have come up with the ultimate comeback to be used on musicians all i have to do is wait for one to put me down and then i can be all
 oh yeah well here in the real world we don't get to rest for 32 bars
hee hee it's funny dromiceiomimus because sometimes in a song musicians get to rest for 32 bars while here in the real world we don't get to do that because we're not um trained musicians
it will work on all musicians just you wait
i will soon
yep here's a tip it's part of the reason we first became friends
oh yeah well here in the real world the rest of us don't have to raise the giant toenail of our second toe up while running to avoid damaging it
i take it back i take it back
who here would like to hear an old joke about oatmeal
then here we go
okay okay so there's this monastery with three monks and only one monk is allowed to speak once each year they take turns the first year at breakfast the first monk speaks and says i hate oatmeal a year later again at breakfast the second monk speaks and says i love oatmeal finally one year later the last monk gets to speak and he says i'm tired of this constant bickering about oatmeal
hee hee comedy gold
but a good one it's funny i think because the conversation is spread over three years and normally you'd expect monks not to talk about oatmeal for that long
is it
dude
i'm afraid i'll have to insist
man i need to stop making all the mistakes today is no more mistakes for t rex day
aw diggity damn somehow i forgot to rinse my toothbrush after use today
well it seems that despite my proclamation i keep on making mistakes
oh tons of mistakes i accidentally offended a friend last night and it was entirely my fault and i feel terrible mistakes like that big mistakes
nopers
i'm not dishing on myself because then you'll clearly spread the gossip around since only gossips would say let's dish also i am sincerely embarrased and ashamed
okay but you have to keep it secret
tee hee
hilarious
comedy relentlessly ensues
hey utahraptor how's your bathroom sink treating you
huh
well i guess i'm not a qualified plumber after all
hey utahraptor how's your bathroom sink treating you
awesome man awesome
the problem with wikipedia is that it's peppered with vandalism at various times and at various locations vandalism that remains until it's noticed by someone who knows enough and cares enough to fix it sometimes this can take a while but
 ahem
ladies and gentlemen i have solved the wikipedia problem
the solution is as brilliant as it is awesome instead of vandalizing the entire encyclopedia we all just agree to vandalize one article leaving the other ones alone that article is the one about chickens why it's pretty obvious dudes already know about chickens
in conceding that one tiny article to the vandals wikipedia wins their victory a fully accurate encyclopedia that covers every topic in the universe 'cept chickens
no way i am doing them a favour
their vandalism problem goes away forever and all that i ask is that chickens become the forbidden topic we never talk about chickens they can say don't ask
i guess we're about to find out i bet fictitional jimbo wales loves the idea
fictional jimbo wales you brought cupcakes
i have the ultimate conversation filler now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations oh yes no longer
because whenever i don't know what to say i'll just exclaim sounds like a good date
an example dromiceiomimus can you describe your ideal waterslide for me
sounds like a good date my friend
utahraptor what are you doing here
we'll see about that
hey mom if you went out on a date with someone would you want them to splash chlorinated water in your eyes
aw mom
i have the ultimate conversation filler now no longer will there be awkward pauses in my conversations oh yes no longer
because whenever i don't know what to say i'll just exclaim sounds like a good date
an example dromiceiomimus can you describe your ideal waterslide for me
sounds like a good date my friend
utahraptor what are you doing here
we'll see about that
hey mom if you went out on a date with someone would you want them to splash chlorinated water in your eyes
aw mom
i am on the lookout for a new friend a new more ultimate friend the best friend ever
i am on the lookout for science personified
it will be so awesome dromiceiomimus can you imagine being friends with science personified you'd never have your science questions go unanswered i'd be all hey how does a bumblebee fly and he'd be all yo dynamic stall and i'd be all sweetness
man he can be a chick if he wants he's science personified
i don't know
all i know is that we'll be able to test our theories of what his name really is through repeatable experimentation and observation
luckily i could just ask invention personified to come up with a way to settle the argument
i'm gonna say yes
something people like to argue about sometimes is whether or not certain things are genetically innate or personal decisions
if it's natural then you can't really blame a person for having it because they didn't have a choice but if it's because of nurture then you can blame them for it or the very least their parents or society
i think so it doesn't change the nature oh ho ho of what's being discussed just its origin
free will
what's that god wanted it to be that way
literally hours of work have paid off and i have come up with my greatest invention yet a duplicator ray
 duplicator rays let you make perfect copies of anything
yep the duplicate is identical in every regard the ray examines the object at the quantum and subquantum levels and thanks to the twin fists of actual science and heisenberg compensators makes a perfect copy indistinguishable from the original
aha on account of how it violates conservation of energy laws
okay yeah it's not original but it's an otherwise perfect duplicate i can destroy economies based on scarcity and generate clean drinking water for everyone i can even duplicate dudes i can't believe you're not more excited i can duplicate brent spiner
ladies and gentlemen is it time for a new catchphrase
sources say damn girl sure is
that's not the new catchphrase though i've got i've got different ones and here they are let's get remarkably frisky useful in many situations that's gobbles meaning that's crazy short for 'gobbledygook' and i lose at sex
you can use i lose at sex for when you lose at sex
losing at sex dude it's right there
it's like when people say you lose at life only better because it's more specific and also suggests that sex is not a competition but that you found a way of making it one and then you lost at it it's the gobbles
shit
i'm unemployed
a negative income tax or nit is when the government pays you money when your income is low pretty sweet
but there is a catch you still pay taxes say a flat tax of 10% but the government also pays you enough to survive this way there's a guaranteed minimum income like welfare but simpler so if you make only $1000 in a year you'll pay $100 in taxes but since the government pays everyone say $10000 you'll end up $9900 ahead in tax money as you make more money you net less from the government until you end up actually paying taxes
yep and a bunch of related programs
it simplifies things plus it includes a flat tax which a lot of amateur economists as well as even some real economists like
utahraptor i just found out that milton friedman proposer of the nit died yesterday at age 94
dude i believe this not to be the case
dude i've been busy
man whatever
first it was romance movies telling me that i won't be truly happy unless i'm in a relationship then it's the media at large and now it's god i am tempted to never love anyone again just to prove a point
i love you too and i'm glad we're friends but man i don't love people asking me when i'm going to get married
argh two weeks
happy i'm going to find someone and we're going to get married and it's going to take two weeks okay
okay well then i'd better get on this
hah hah you sure do love your chips jodie foster
i'm going nuts
liquid nuts
see what i did there dromiceiomimus i used liquid as an intensifier
yep it goes nuts super nuts nutty crackers and then liquid nuts for only the nuttiest things
you know it can't that would be heresy
exactly
okay honestly it can apply to chocolate bars but it becomes confusing if the bar isn't crammed with nuts or somehow liquidly nutty there is a semantic collision
anyway i meant what i said about going nuts i feel like i've got this powerful instinct for self destruction and i'm just fooling myself if i think i can control it
i'm wacky times
man i've been feeling down all morning what could possibly cheer me up

and so my damn freaky raccoon and cephalopod neighbors were all penetration and then i froze and then i ran away why are they always up in my base freaking out my dudes
you'd react too it's damn unsettling plus they shouted after me about a new sexual position argh
i have no idea
and i don't want to find out you'd think that anything that could be invented has already been pretty much covered
they don't like me they just like freaking me out
no thank you i am busy with non disgusting activities
sometimes when you're in an accident or about to be hurt time seems to slow down this gives you more of a chance to react to ensure your survival
this is awesome
assuming that time isn't actually changing this means that my brain has the incredible ability to slow down my perception of time i must harness this dromiceiomimus
i could become truly unstoppable i could read books faster and also do well on timed tests
i am seriously trying to evolve so hard over here
nope
there is one way to find out
i&#8217 m trapped in a body that moves so slowly as to seem motionless ah well at least i have plenty of time to think about&#8230 mammalian breasts
self what is the deal with mammalian breasts
god do you think i'm a good enough dude to write an opera
man even god thinks i can't write an opera
well the consensus seems to be that opera is the classiest of the classical arts if i could write a great opera it would mean that i was awesome at composing music and awesome at writing words for dudes and ladies to sing it would also mean that i could move people with my amazing understanding of emotions
 i am i am
 i'm empathetic watch watch me be so empathetic right now
 perhaps you have not yet noticed my odd pronunciation of empathetic hinting at a pun and a belief at odds with my literal speech
 sweet
 i'm glad we're friends
remember my friend female who dated her roommate also female that is not the only sexy adventure she has had
not by a long shot
like this one time she had a gentleman caller spend the night nothing happened but the next day while she was at work this guy did all her dishes for her
then that night they had sexual congress
coincidence
sex for clean dishes exactly
and i'm just pointing out now we can tease her by offering to do her dishes and raising our eyebrows i'm gonna do it like this
hello can i clean your dishes
someone's been spreading some stupid
 about me
dromiceiomimus did you hear the rumour about me
it's terrible someone has been telling people that the only reason i stomp on things is because i have issues parental issues it makes me say this what
hells yes
i'm not gonna stop i'm going to show people that the reason i stomp on things is because stomping on things is truly excellent you should try it
you know what that doesn't bother me because i'm starting my own t rex rumour tell your friends that i stomp things because whenever i kiss someone they always pull away smile give me a double thumbs up and then run off over the horizon yelling totally radical
it's frustrating
it's time to spice things up dudes and ladies today i am only going to make bad decisions
it's exciting dromiceiomimus and i guess i do like the idea of bad decisions more than i like the you know actual consequences of bad decisions but this might cure me of that at least
i haven't made any yet
the only idea i have right now is to invent kitchen appliances that somehow crave the flesh of the living that'd be a bad decision right
excellent
don't try to eat me toaster
i can see you licking your lips while looking at my sumptuous belly toaster
oh it's on
man forget discovering the true nature of reality
how exactly am i supposed to lose my ego and become enlightened through meditation saying practice doesn't count what i want is unambiguous non metaphorical step by step instructions buddha is supposed to be a dude who took steps to move from unenlightened to enlightened right is there any reason why the steps he took are not understandable communicable repeatable and verifiable
that doesn't matter
yes please
excuse me buddhist monks i'm gonna owe god fifty bucks if i don't get enlightened soon
it snowed last night the first snow of the year
it's sincerely excellent
i'm sure in a few months i will be bored with the snow but right now it is exciting and magical and makes everything look pretty
indeed also this car appears to be recently driven causing the snow on it to blow away
this is true
that explains why we're all not wearing snowsuits and it's too bad because we'd look adorable can you imagine
aww i'd be a cutie
yes today truly has been a day of frustrated expectations
i have come up with a hilarious three level pun dromiceiomimus check it out instead of saying i'll play it by ear i point to my ear and say i guess i'll play it by here
hah hah hah
 but that is just level one of pun i'm also pointing to my ear and saying here so there's level two a visual pun and level three is how here sounds like hear and you can use ears to hear things i'll play it by hear i e by how i hear it it is a perfect storm of wordplay dromiceiomimus they make movies out of perfect storms
guess what everyone my pun is still awesome
guess what utahraptor it is great and weeks from now you'll be apologizing to me for not recognizing it's uncut brilliance
guess what everyone
you all suck
how come nobody has ever sent me a telegram telegrams are old skool classiness given physical form
one telegram please
not hardly telegrams were better because they made you go to the door to get them which meant folks knew you were popular and getting an important message plus they charged by the word so people were concise also i think you had to write stop instead of a period so the messages were rad stop
you will
awesome wow thanks utahraptor you're a real friend
i've never been more intrigued
if i could give up any sense what would it be it's not going to be hearing or talking because i do those all the time
whatevs
and i don't want to give up touch because then i'd be bumping my body into spikes and barely even noticing taste wouldn't be too bad but i'd miss tasting tasty things i think it would have to be smell assuming that wouldn't impact taste
yeah but so's sight and i can also use sight to check out women and dictionaries
really why's that
hah man i would love to give up that sense can you imagine
it would probably go down like this ask me if i want to go get a pizza
sure also i
 i have controversial theories about emigration
i like most men have stepped on a few tiny women in my day
this i claim
however i don't claim to be a misogynist it is a problem that the very tall face when confronted with the very tiny sometimes you step on them by accident
i am merely shading it from the sun and then my foot gets heavy and tired
yes i am
daaamn tiny women that's crazy come closer for a sec
here are some bad kisses i have had boy howdy
kiss the first one time i was seriously kissing a lady and thought of how bad it would be if i started laughing right then and the image of her being so pissed at me was so funny that i laughed right into her mouth 16 months later we broke up coincidence
don't try to change me baby
kiss the second one time i kissed a woman who just threw up
well i didn't know she'd just thrown up she tried to warn me
 wait i just threw and then we were smoochin' i thought she was going to say out all doubts i had about our kissing in the near future
i miss her
god i've been watching a pretty good tv show lately it's called scrubs it's pretty okay
what
you're crazy will and grace is terrible they always forget to put in jokes in their episodes scrubs is comedy gold compared to will and grace
you know what will and grace is will and grace is congealed human suffering
god about sitcoms
he's the one who's crazy he likes will and grace damn it now he's making me look crazy
what
what have i done with my life for serious i am getting older and if things keep up this way i will die an unremarkable dude
my epitaph will be here lies and unremarkable dude but hey i get there's someone rad to the left d
actually that's a pretty sweet epitaph
but my concerns about my own lack of impact still stand
you're going to say that i've made a positive impact in the life of my friends et cetera but i'm talking about well i guess i'm talking about public love and recognition you know who won a nobel oscar price at age 26
not me
good spirit are these the shadows of the things that will e or are they the shadows of things that may be only
'cause my epitaph sucks
i am a dude with some seriously uninformed opinions about archaeology
okay we're digging up stuff all the time right and talk to any archaeologist and they'll complain about sites that have been damaged or destroyed by under informed victorian archaeologists that didn't have the knowledge and skills we have today doesn't it stand to reason that in 100 years we'll be making the same complaints about today's work we only have so much history shouldn't we wait until we've perfected archaeology before we dig
true
but dudes and ladies have finite lifetimes the past isn't going anywhere we can dig it up whenevs
perhaps
man that's not hard i suck at flying but fully expect future t rexes to be flying all over the place
thanks to the heady power of evolution
yes i have actually done some research this time schwing
and it turns out i was totally correct
archaeologists are aware that they're mining a finite resource and when possible they only dig a little and leave some for the future but there are time limits often they'll be examining a site just before it's dug up for a new building of something which means this is their last chance to see what's there before it's destroyed and sometimes the ground is volatile enough that if they don't dig soon whatever's there will be lost anyway
in conclusion and in summary way to go archaeologists
damn it archaeologists
dear recipient of this comic
you and whoever went this card to you totally have a history together
that's pretty intriguing isn't it what sort of history did you used to date there's a lot i don't know about your history
maybe it's one sided maybe you don't even know who the sender is maybe he's this guy and he thinks you have this history and you don't know him from bob
yes good idea
aww
anyway enjoy your failed relationship s
someone going by the all caps name zach morris has tagged my house my front door is now spraypainted with zach 's stupid name for jerks i don't even like saved by the bell that much
forget you zach morris
yeah but this isn't art it's tagging it's just some dude's made up name taggers are like dogs marking their territory wherever they can and zach morris is just a dog who likes implausible high school scenarios either that i guess or mark paul gosselaar is bored and experimenting
explain
utahraptor you are zach morris
someone going by the all caps name zach morris has tagged my house my front door is now spraypainted with zach 's stupid name for jerks i don't even like saved by the bell that much
forget you zach morris
yeah but this isn't art it's tagging it's just some dude's made up name taggers are like dogs marking their territory wherever they can and zach morris is just a dog who likes implausible high school scenarios either that i guess or mark paul gosselaar is bored and experimenting
explain
utahraptor you are zach morris
a new year is coming up that means it is time to take stock of my life and make resolutions for improvements in the year to come
resolution one
eat less chickens
i mean eat fewer chickens fewer is when you can count them and less is when it's more of a mass and less countable right like i'd eat less rice but i'd eat fewer countably many grains of rice
oh dromiceiomimus denied
of course after we talk about less and fewer
isn't it neat that we have this distinction in english between fewer and elss but the opposite more covers both those cases our language is asymmetrical if you want to encode countability in your greater than comparison word then good luck hah good luck with that my friend
i also resolve to get more smooches from ladies
fop is one of the rarest conditions known to medicine
it's a genetic disorder that causes muscles and connective tissue to literally change to bone as more and more tissue becomes bone joints become fused and the inflicted person is eventually left ossified and completely unable to move attempts to remove the extra bone simply result in further bone growth it is a very painful disease and there is no cure but the gene that causes it has recently been found which gives us hope
not really
we're spreading awareness of the condition which is a good thing
who's making jokes i'm not making jokes
smoochitis is when you have a medical case of the smooches
dromiceiomimus do you have smoochitis
we should smooch to make extra sure
she had smoochitis
the only cure further smooching symptoms include smooches and caressing about the neck and buttocks
it's my specialty baby
i am getting old which is fine except i'm starting to worry that all i do is young guy stuff and not mature adult stuff like having a mortgage or owning more than one pair of nice pants
i'm a little surprised by my own feelings i've always been a guy to be fully behind doing what you want and screw society but i there's a part of me whispering come on get a real job and a mortgage and live a real life it'll be raaaad maybe it's societal conditioning but it's there i guess i either need to change my life or my opinions or accept that little bit of discomfort for as long as i live
yes with my life
maybe i guess i look at people with real responsibility and wonder if maybe it'd be nice and if i'm being left behind i don't know i never wanted to be canonically adult before
so dromiceiomimus do you know how to draw superheroes i've got such a great idea for a comic
sweet okay so the idea is there's this guy lee right one day he gains super powers and i'm not sure how he gets them yet but basically he's got this slot in the top of his head and he can write words on cards and put them in the slot so he gains those qualities so say a decision has to be made he writes decisive on a card and forces it into his head and he becomes decisive lee he then has the power to do things decisively super decisively
precisely
but not just precise lee he can be compelling lee obliging lee even furious lee but the catch is the cards stick out so enemies know what they're dealing with oh cool we're dealing with conclusive lee they'll say we can ask him some questions
have i truly won every single award in comics
i'm a dude who's really not that religious i'm not a big believer in deities
but i don't like it when someone says they've lost their faith because of me
because faith is something i don't really have it's sort of like a sandcastle right and i don't want to be the guy that goes around kicking other people's sandcastles even if they thank me afterwards faith is something rare at least for me and i'd hate to take it away from someone else
not really
thant's not what i'm saying who'd have thought this frank talk about religion would result in heated debate
well i guess that gives us more time to talk about i don't know dogs i guess we could talk about dogs
today is the day yes
today is the day i lose my fear of zombies
the way i see it zombies are either avoidable or too effective the only way to become a zombie is to be bitten by one but not to get eaten yes then the bite kills you and you come back as a zombie but zombies want to eat you it's only the sucky ones that bite you and don't finish the job so if the first zombie was really good the infection wouldn't spread because he'd cold eat all his victims and if he was sucky you could just avoid him on account of his suckiness
problem solved
yes zombies are too effective to be contagious that's why they can't exist in real life
i take it back i take it back
i have discovered the ultimate secret to comedy the more obscure a joke is the less people there are who'll get it but the more they'll find it correspondingly hilarious i suspect this law progresses geometrically
for example
let's say i have a joke about how cats like to sleep not funny right dromiceiomimus everyone who's met a sleepy ol' cat can get that but if i have a joke about how say an obscure programming language is pretty wacky then people who know that language will feel like i'm talking to them they laugh both at the joke and in recognition comedy increases and the only reasonable conclusion is laughs ahoy
so logically all i have to do is find a really rich guy and tell him a joke only he'd find funny and i'm set for life
dude rich people love to give people money when they make them laugh and i'm going to track down patrick stewart and make him laugh so hard you don't even know
um he commanded the enterprise
dude we have to steal it
god we're going to steal the kilogram
now we're gonna have to use out cleverness because it's probably well protected seeing how it's the only real kilogram in the entire universe
i have the brash enthusiasm of an amateur and the body of a tyrannosauroid
no one about about nothing
ha ha nope i'd have to be god himself to pull of that impressive caper
hee hee that's it for science bitches
so light behaves like both a particle and a wave right and i can hit dudes with particles is there nothing stopping me from making a light cannon which when fired throws dudes up against the wall
weaponized photons
 but then how do solar sails work and photon engines don't they work by photons pushing against things has science fiction been lying through its science teeth
perhaps
and if solar sails work then so too will my light cannon i'll just need tons of light
that my friend would be a pretty sweet cannon slash flash light quick to professor science's house
 sure he is professor science it's t rex utahraptor and dromiceiomimus we brought labcoats
have i truly never thrown my hands up in the air and waved them all around like i just don't care
i don't see what the big deal about it is i barely feel funkier
i guess i feel a little funkier a little
oh yeah says you utahraptor
i'm watching
i want to write something that'll make people see the world through fresh eyes something they'll want to pass on to their children
basically
except that's been done i want something new that will touch the heart of everyone without exception
i guess i bet some authors just want to tell jokes about dinosaurs though
i can't i need inspiration
brilliant you've really helped me out utahraptor
i call my tale the alluring person with hidden greatness just like you who accidentally let down someone he loves but then made amends and they kissed an action packed tale of the star wars universe but afterwards they visit the enterprise and bender is there
it's neat how most of our key verbs are just one syllable long i think that verbs we use a lot change to short words with time since if they did not it would take a real long time to say all the run of the mill thoughts we have
we'd get bored each time we'd try to talk
sex love hate bone all are rad and short verbs i bet you could use just short words and find it to be not that hard of a trick
well that verb form is for chumps i said it that verb form is for true chumps
in fact i do
there's a set store of short words right a hoard if you will if we used all the short word forms for weird and rare verbs like i don't know to eat a lot of pork then it would take a long time to share a thought that did not come down to dudes i want to eat pigs
i have one word for you my friend
daaaaaaaaaamn
why can't i say two things at the same time i've tried just now and all i got out of it was a passport stamped for failure towne
apparently dude
but saying a word is just generating a sound wave right i could record myself twice saying different things and then superimpose their waves to get a new one then all i'd need to do is train myself to produce that wave and it would sound like i'm saying two things at once i could even do it by rote then when people ask me to do things i could say yes and no at the same time and then they'd probably dislike me a little
balderdash
you're just saying that because you've never seen it done dear friend but i'm gonna do it i'm gonna figure out how to shape my tongue and mouth and vocal cords to generate the appropriate waveform and then i'm gonna travel the world saying two things at once
hey t rex
t rex
you would actually prefer to stay at home and renew old friendships
i got it yeah
but come on how are mmorpgs firm and sexy sauce they're clearly less firm and sexy and more online role playing games that charge by the month and never end
alright i'm done with this conversation
done with talking to the devil so done
we were talking about naming things which was fine actually but then he used that to segue into what turns him on i don't want to know that that's gross and unwarranted
no and i don't want to
i have perfected and bottled inspiration take a swig you'll feel inspired
no no it's nothing like that it's actual bottled inspiration i came up with it when i chemically and accidentally created just a little inspiration and when i drank that i was inspired to create more there's a whole pool full of it back at my house you can drown in it
secrets and chemicals a mix of both i guess
whatever dude i know enough to come up with ingestible inspiration it tastes like success
that's inspiring i'm inspired
critical mass rides are when a hundred or more cyclists get together and go on a bike ride they take over a lane of traffic and get to set their pace the motto and politics are we don't block traffic we are traffic
it's good times if you're not in a car
i find it encouraging when i see a bunch of bikes taking over a road and just going on their way the noise of traffic is replaced by the softer sound of spokes and gears it's pretty neat
oh they still pull over to let those through they just don't let cars merge in with the bikes because it's dangerous
depends on who you ask dude
and where you live i suppose i don't know i know i like to ride bikes and i believe they're as entitled to the road as cars the end
wow look at all those cannibals on bikes
that is technically true cannibals
nope
man you're the devil &#8212 buy your own video games you must have hellbux&#8482 or something
okay good to know
aw come on no
one sec utahraptor fine if i ever get a new video game console you can come over and play video games on it once
you have a grandmother how does that fit into judeo christian normative beliefs
i have the best idea selling hugs it is a recipe for instant profits the lonely will pay me three dollars for the squeezy special
all i need is a female business partner dromiceiomimus
that's on account of how some people want a woman hug and that is one hug i can't provide on my own
you have a job what do you do
dromiceiomimus is a nautical engineer
no of course not i'm just shocked that she could become an engineer and i knew nothing about it i guess i don't know her as well as i though i must be a crappy friend
would the dude who is truly sick please raise the roof
oh wait it's me
what i do not today is an aberration
a bluff
i've got a cold
the only cure for kissing fever is a little tongue
it's symptomatic of the fever
other symptoms include the skin of my back flaking off in great big sheets
disgusted it could happen to you remember my warning well utahraptor you too dromiceiomimus you too danni the intriguingly sexy woman who is only seen in flashbacks
nanites are tiny robots they're so tiny that they can robotically mess with things at the molecular level
pretty darned sweet my friends
the dream is that you could pour a vial of nanites on your bed and they'd transform it at the nano level into a better bed or a big ol' pile of tasty burgers you could eliminate hunger dispose of waste and so on the only downside is that the nanites could malfunction reproduce without check and reduce all life to a featureless grey goo
or to burgers
maybe
i am probably confusing science fiction nanites with real nanites but one thing we can all agree on is that nanites are pretty neat
yes we can
it's nanite versus manite two titans battling for dominance of my affections
guys i know
george mallory and andrew irvine were the two british dudes who first tried to climb mount everest
their last sighting was just a few hundred metres from the summit they never made it back a standard mountaineering tale except that if they had made it to the top they'd have been the first and they were carrying cameras if we could find the frozen cameras we could still retrieve images from them today and then we'd know if they actually did make it to the top since who climbs mount everest and doesn't take a picture nobody that's who
only one
mallory's body was found 75 years later but no cameras were on him irvine's body is still up there somewhere maybe with the cameras
that's ridiculous
sure are how hard could it be it's just like climbing stairs only longer
and if i stay too long at the top of the stairs i'll die
they sure do we're going straight to the top baby we'll see if the deadly everest eliminator exists or not some claim he's a wacky murderer who pushes people off the peak when they're least expecting it others say that's stupid
we're going because it's there and also because we won free tickets from the radio also because hired sherpas will do most of the work
well i'm going because it's there and to prove that there's no murderer called the everest eliminator at the top
he only tried to pus me a li'l
yep
 tall
whatever man it was tall it was also cold it was cold and tall
aw man
god's gonna put out a new bible in which he makes fun of my powers of tautological description
it's okay you tried
do do you actually rule the schools at eating sloppy joes though
i'm not buying one
dude i'm not buying a book where you insult me
you you dedicated bible ii to me i'm not sure how i feel about that
fine give me a copy
and i'm not evern sure how he got it published one passage reads rhumba thumba farts and shoes i want y'all to be nice to yous because of how dumb it is i can never forget that sentence
what happened to it
you you dedicated bible ii to me i'm not sure how i feel about that
oh morris
i just realized that no women have ever been to the moon only dudes dudes who returned as men
apparently you need a sausage to get on the moon
yep i know we're being sensationalistic here since there's only been thirteen people on the moon ever and that's a pretty small sample size but still no women no grandmothers no sullen teens female just men
also no asians
is there a reason why all the apollo missions were crewed by dudes
i guess and i guess you could make an argument for sexy is distracting on the moon but sexy is distracting everywhere you know
excuse me sir would you like to buy a button that reads return to the moon and don't forget the chicks this time
it may sir
i just can't get enough of this one song the beach boys help me rhonda i think i'll play it on repeat for 49 minutes
one more time
i had to turn up the tunes because i was going outside i don't have a boom box or similar portable music device
such as the ipod shuffle
it's my new favorite song
fine i'll play a different song
hello cops
am i going to jail cops
oh my god i had the best sleep last night the best sleep ever it was it was such a good sleep easily easily the best sleep of my life
therefore it's all downhill from here
no sleep could possibly compare with my sleep from last night even in the sleep of death i will be all this sleep is pretty good but man that other sleep i had it was rad it was so rad
i will spend all my time being dead remembering that sleep how could i not this was a sleep for ages
sure am sweetcheeks
wait what sweetcheeks i'm sorry i don't know where that came from i don't normally call people sweetcheeks
a new lunar year and guess who's still not married
the answer is me
daaaaaaaaaaaaamn
daaamn
daaaaaamn
daaaaaaaaaamn
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
if you want to get married then first you need to find a mate you need to find a life partner
once you have that partner then all you have to do is commit to them for the rest of your life and they to you it's really that easy it's like buying a game boy opening it up and then saying yes this is enough i will never get tired of tetris
also the game boy loves you back
aaand you're not allowed to loan the game boy out to friends unless you and the game boy talk about it first
utahraptor it's an analogy
yes that is a fair and accurate impression of me and my awesome desription of marriage
but don't you see by casting marriage in terms of game boys i make it seem accessible fun affordable and sexy
they are 18 years old this year for your information
also what the hell did i just say
i was going to write a science fiction story but then i stopped i realized i don't know what science fiction as a genre means
seriously i had some doubts
if i was writing a western i could go on and on about order versus freedom civilization versus the wilderness the hero as a man stuck between these two worlds and so on but what's science fiction about is it just literature with space ships and robots and casually inverted flux variance aliens stopped being parallels for the other long ago didn't they
so
my other problem is i don't have a plotline either
once upon a time there was a cat he was obese
i saw him on the bus
poker sure seems to be popular lately does the road to financial independence truly pass through gambling towne usa
there's one way to find out
yeah but you can lose at lotteries because it's just chance right but in poker you can bluff in theory i can bluff my way into the annals of poker history and the annals of neighbours with suspicious amounts of disposable income all at the same time all i need is a good poker face
what i've got mad skills at poker
that is advice for people without the ultimate poker face check this out
poooooker
i've doubled my money
i guess i've been pretty lucky to get this far without making any big life altering mistakes i think the biggest mistake i ever made was mixing up some juice from concentrate that had a ladybug in it
i was experimenting with mixing juice with a blender and i guess there was a ladybug in the blender all i know is that when the blender turned off and the smoke cleared my hitherto delicious juice had clearly identifiable ladybug pieces floating on top i recall saying aw man my juice
no of course not
but that's not what i wanted to talk about i wanted to talk about how one bad decision can totally change your life you know lost limbs broken friendships unexpected pregnancies with someone you don't really like stuff like that
fine it was the worst juice everyone it had guts in it
the essential problem with superman as a character is that he's too powerful and incorruptible he's a walking deus ex machina you give him a foe he can't beat and all he has to do is try harder and then he beats the guy
what i'm saying is that this is not truly satisfying
the way to make supes interesting is to put him up against a problem that he can't fix by punching someone through a building put him in a situation where say everyone he loves starts dying of a disease that he can't detect or cure passing away in his arms one by one at the end he's left as the sole survivor of the doomed planet earth six billion dead only this time he had a chance to stop the disaster and he failed
it's modern and dark
i bet if superman were real he'd like my story he'd say to me that was a super interesting story t rex
superman if i jump off this building will you save me
will you save me though
i'm just gonna jump real quick okay
alright time for me to meet a nice woman named samantha as per my prediction of yesterday i will romance her until she no longer desires further romancin' the romancin' will be mutual
what i can be romantic
hold on a sec i'll get you some chocolates and diamonds
chocolates plus diamonds equals romance dude
well utahraptor you're going to have to take that up with tv print and radio commercials who disagree
'kay i 'll see you kids later
oh goodness do i love alternate histories what would the world be like if nazis won world war ii
i know let's watch a movie to find out
i think what i like is the fun of going back and finding one event and just flipping it then reasonably tracing the changes up to the present it really can be an intellectual exercise i also like how alternate histories imply that each of our daily actions could have timeline altering consequences
perhaps
but utahraptor perhaps not
now if you'll excuse me i'm going to change all our tomorrows farewell
i'm writing a story in which i eat a lot of sandwiches then i'm gonna actually eat a lot of sandwiches
i have a pretty good knowledge of my closest friends i know their likes and dislikes and can predict how they'd react in most situations
i have constructed nothing less than friend simulators in my very mind
it's pretty great dromiceiomimus sometimes i'll ask myself what's utahraptor probably doing this weekend or what would dromiceiomimus do if she found out i ate all these chicken legs and i use my friend simulators to asnwer these questions
they didn't
like you
he fills in when you're not around or when it'd be ridiculous to ask you what you thought of something he also tells me what you want for your birthday what's your t rex simulator like
booooooooooooooners
 maybe today is the day i meet the love of my life but only if i go to the supermarket because that's where she is
 i should get some friggin' groceries
 but maybe she's not at the grocery store maybe she's nearby and by going to the grocery store i'd miss her and we'd never meet maybe i'm sabotaging my future right now as i speak
 the point is that if you've only got one true love in the world then the odds of meeting her are super small
 oh we did
 but then i realized i can probably love one lady more than another rank them by happiness and you've got my best match my true love right at the top
 full potential happy eh hmm
 is she nice
okay i am going to write a story and it will be something brand new it will be the most staggeringly original story ever it will feature action and characters that could never have been conceived by anyone but me
i call shenanigans on that what are these 10 basic stories then
that one is not a real story
ridiculous
all that means is that if you boil the story down to its most superficial aspect then yeah you can connect it to terminator ii but then you might as well treat every story as a sequel prequel or rewrite of terminator ii
it's an okay story but as a terminator sequel it profoundly disappoints on every conceivable level
back to my amazing story &#8220 tuqqy the tugboat tugs in space &#8221 it&#8217 s about a non anthropomorphized tugboat who tugs in space his windshield does not double as eyes tugboats are not like that
in any case one day a killer asteroid is discovered headed straight for earth
tuggy&#8217 s our only chance &#8212 our last best hope for survival all of our tomorrows ride on the non anthropomorphic shoulders of one tuggy t tugboat in space will he be able to do it will he be able to save us all and become our greatest hero
he is just a regular tugboat dromiceiomimus
character development
look at you mr &#8220 i can&#8217 t suspend my disbelief for a space tugboat named &#8216 tuggy&#8217 &#8221 he moves by pushing against the aether okay
yes look at me look at me and buy my story and find out if tuggy saves us all
the answer is yes
okay so nobody has bought my tuggy story this is their loss tuggy and i don't mind instead i will give them another story about a superhero a superhero called
 spoiler alert
that's her name spoiler alert when she shows up the bad guys yell spoiler alert to warn each other also when people type it online it means they just saw her run by as they were typing they wanted to share tada
they shorten because they're alarmed
oh it's true
i want tuggy t tugboat to be my great success spoiler alert just feels so commercial you know
aww thanks utahraptor
but spoiler alert wears a flapper swimsuit when she ruins endings she can't help but make me money
they're what every man desires but cannot express
everyone knows about hetero homo a and bi sexuals they are old hat here are some wxciting new sexualities
you are attracted to everything ever sweet good luck dude or lady
it's where you only like yourself you sure must be something' else
fine they can be called autosexual and people who only like themselves will be solosexuals
 we are having sex righth now
you go in circles around things or something i don't know
you're sexy at sea okay i'm done
that one's crazy
today is pi day that means you get to eat pie at 1 59 pm or 1 59 am if you're up i don't know
i feel a profound disconnect with this holiday
i get that it's celebrating the universal constant pi and that it's celebrated today because 3 14159 can be translated into mach 14th 1 59 but what makes pi so special why don't we celebrate euler's number day on february 71st
hah now that is a holiday i can get behind
sure can dude
it's a holiday for people who are good enough just not transcendental they do their best they get by alright in most situations just don't try to build a bridge with them you know
not failure utahraptor approximations of success
on july 22 instead of eating pie i'm just going to sort of rub pie around my face and call it a day
failure is just success rounded down my friend
what i miss is scenes in movies where people would be yelling at each other and then they'd both stop stare at each other for a beat and then they'd be making out why does that not happen anymore it was awesome
 it was seriously awesome
and time was it was a necessary feature of every great movie just like car chases are today you could go into a theatre and be guaranteed the slap across the face
necessary and sufficient
and like i said they're fantastic but they don't lend themselves to the smooches today's actors could yell at each other and then make out during a car chase but they never do
well i keep waiting
when i die i want to be buried in a bog i want to become a bog person
sure am
the acidic and anaerobic bog water will preserve and tan my soft tissues while dissolving the calcium in my bones the end result is that thousands of years later someone will find my body still posed as i requested it just a little floppy because there's no skeleton holding me up this is how i wanna spend eternity also posed giving a fonzie style double thumbs up and holding a sign that says dudes what's shakin'
probably if not we can make it out of soft tissues
it'll give future historians something to talk about they will say wow who was this incredible man
 why was he so concerned with what was shakin' with the dudes
 is that what killed him
anachronism is when you have technology being used before it was invented it happens whenever shakespeare listens to his mp3s
ah anachronism it can also happen by accident like when an author forgets that people didn't write with ballpoint pens 100 years ago or that elves didn't have friggin' computers sometimes if it's a really obvious error it can be played for comedy
it is an advanced literary technique used by only our most handsome authors
unfortunately no
time machines are a special case if there is a time machine in the story then a lot of anachronism can be explained by the time machine and is thus no longer anachronism
yeah it's the best
shakespeare are you listening to your mp3s again
anthropomorphism is when you have things that normally can't talk walking around and behaving like people it happens whenever a toaster flips you off
anthropomorphism is often used in childrens' stories where you have talking animals but can also be used in more adult works this is because occasionally adults enjoy it when a cat is sassy sometimes a character will be anthropomorphized by mistake like when you write a play and accidentally attribute dialogue to a ceiling tile the ceiling tile is said to be anthropomorphized if the oversight is not corrected in a timely fashion
aw man really
well you're welcome anytime you need anthropomorphism explained just drop me a line
shakespeare are you flipping off your toaster again it's 3 am
allusion is a reference to a person place or thing in a piece of literature like when picard mentions moby dick in star trek first contact
allusions are pretty handy because they allow you to summarize potentially complex ideas with one succinct reference essentially piggybacking on the brilliance of previously established works however if the audience isn't familiar with the reference the alluson fails and can seem weird or out of place
sure have
um i kinda realized that i'd like to have children one day but i need to have a girlfriend for that first
shakespeare you should write a story where elephants get to be our pals
what's the matter william too chicken to work it in
in conclusion anachronism anthropomorphism and allusion are the only three literary techniques there aren't any others okay there were some others but they died
all dead today's readers yawn in the face of foreshadowing they wince when seeing any events that occur after the climax they throw up a little when a part is used to represent the whole you can tell when that's happened because you'll go to the library and hear synedoche bleggh
people throw up all the time too
coincidence utahraptor or something more
i guess i am let me just check with an actual doctor real quick though
can you check my eyes next doctor
i think there's something wrong with my pupils since they've turned into cartoon hearts
i've decided that if i ever get to travel back in time again i'm going to the battle of salamis in which the greeks beat the persians turning the tide in their war which led tot he eventual greek victory
it has been described as the single most important battle in history
this is because had the greeks lost then so too would the early idea of democracy been denied its initial flourishing which could have affected all of western civilization seeing how influential western civilization has been on the world if i am a dude who wants to make wild unpredictable changes to the history of time this seems like the place and time to do it
i don't know maybe
it might be cool to just watch the battle but it also might be cool to go back and cold start stepping on butterflies like crazy then come back to the present and be all oh snap my bathroom is now teal
wow where'd you guys pick up english
what zero replies
but my clock is ticking
 zero replies on my awesome personal ad maybe it was too awesome maybe maybe there was a spelling mistake
man i'll never have kids at this rate
i don't know maybe but it would be years down the road the thing is if i want kids i have to meet someone fall in love convince her to fall in love with me etc and then get married and then have children and man that can be a long process i need to start planning now if i want children in the next 10 years i need to start hedging my bets
always an option my friend
but if i want to build a family in the classical way and i'm not sure that i do but i might in the future i need to get on that now
oh nevermind there really was a spelling mistake
no wonder all the sexy babes were turned off
sheesh t rex
who owes me money utahraptor owes me money
homeboy owes me 30 bucks
dromiceiomimus does utahraptor owe you any money because he owes me 30 bucks and i was thinking if he owes you money too maybe we could team up and get him to pay
utahraptor keeps money and friends separate my money and me the friend that is
you owe me 30 clams 30 buckazoids
hah hah yeah i remember those they were insane
they tasted like chalk but looked like jane austen fishstick austen
it turns out that's all i ever wanted in a mealtime treat
people don't want traditional they want new and sexy if people wanted traditional we'd all be driving around on model t horses or whatever
with that in mind i have started a new religion buddhism 2
buddhism 2 is like buddhism but bigger badder and better than ever if you liked the four noble truths you'll love that we've doubled them up giving you eight sexy new truths to choose from and if you believe suffering is caused by desire well then get ready to suffer because we've taken nirvana and kicked it up to the max you won't believe your eyes
thanks man
buddhism 2 also includes the startling revelation that buddha had a daughter wow she's the slim and sexy new smilin' face of buddhism now in a tiny red bikini would you like to know more
buddhists are you interested in trading up to a religion with sixteen collectible cups
is there any conceivable better form of music than out of genre cover songs the answer is no the full answer is no there is nothing better i love them all so much i can never take this back
they're great because say you love a particular hip hop song but wouldn't you love it even more if it was an opera yes you would also wouldn't you love arias ten times better as gangsta rap songs here again the answer is yes i don't know why all music is apparently produced originally in the wrong genre as the one nature intended but i accept it and thank those artists bold enough to see beyond the limits of generic form
that's part of it true
i like the feeling of looking in on an alternate universe that sense of familiarity altered but recognizable but even without it some are just really great songs that stand on their own
it's the song i hear in my head whenever i close my eyes
ladies pleasing a man is easy
here are some simple sexy secrets to pleasing your man
men love a woman who remembers his birthday try remembering your man's birthday and them when the big day comes tell him you hope he has a good time because he deserves it
it works on all men who have been born
solid
finally experiment with remembering your man's interests that way when a gift is called for you can look for one that dovetails nicely with his interests he won't forget it
i agree i would say that if the relationship is failing despite these tips then you and your man may have insurmountable fundamental differences even if you love each other more than you can say nothing is meant to last forever ladies
anyway
food for thought
dudes that is correct
i have used my in with the ladies to spread around some tips
i told them that we like birthdays and cool presents and when they are nice now chicks will know what we like i know there are some men out there who would have preferred i'd given more salacious tips like how to please man in the milieu of the bed room but that is ridiculous here is how you please a man in the milieu of the bed room i dunno maybe sexual intercourse will do the trick
nope just regular sexism
it's a joke that plays off gender stereotypes here i'll prove it via the scientific method of asking random men what they think
excuse me male pedestrians
would you say you can distinguish between good and bad sex
wait a minute wait just a minute
fruits are insane
i plant a banana tree and i come back a while later and it's transformed dirt into bananas fruit is just congealed sunlight and dirt that's crazy dromiceiomimus how do plants do it i wouldn't know where to even start transforming sun and dirt into bananas i would be totally lost
what if i want bananas though
aw man i did
i guess i should've put impressed by fruit on my new business cards huh
there was a sale
i have a brilliant idea for revenging myself against tv's kelsey grammer oh yes
all i have to do is put out a major motion picture and include in it a brilliant role for kelsey it will be a dazzling moving role but will also play to his type as a smart yet sassy older man it'll be a role that screams kelsey grammer a touchstone that defines a generation and a career i'll even name the character kelsey g then i'm gonna just go ahead and give it to somebody else sorry kelsey too bad for you there huh
nothing he seems like a nice guy
yep
listen it's good to be prepared
hello kelsey grammer
kelsey we're on speakphone
 i think your voice is a wonderful gift
the opposite of solipsism where you believe you are the only real person who is imagining a universe is antisolipsism in which you believe everyone is real except you i may have just made this up anyway
you believe you're totally fake
you're just a sustained figment of everyone else's imagination the only issue with that is how everyone is imagining the same dude at the same time so well
perhaps
yes
if you buy into solipsism then what are the odds you're the chosen one maybe there's some actual solipsist who really is the only real thing going and they're imagining everything for you even when you're not around what a card huh what a crazy dude
if you believe one person can imagine a universe you have to believe they can imagine your thoughts too and then you've got no reason to believe you're real
then ice cream
similar to antisolipsism but actually real is the cotard delusion in which the person affected believes they have died
so it goes
the condition was first identified over 100 years ago this is unfortunate because it was identified before the proper nomenclature was in place it should've been called i think i might be a zombieitis
'i think i might be a zombie who's fullitis
oh what you'd expect really
a disconnect with life a sense of emotional and physiological flatness which may be a symptom or a cause of the disorder it's very rare but one that i imagine is quite upsetting for everyone involved sometimes the person affected won't eat
yep this continues a theme in my life of being terrified of all that can go wrong with my brain hey you wanna invent a way to transform our minds into something non physical so that we can live safely forever
radical
panpsychism is the belief that everything in the universe has consciousness not just chicks and dudes but even inorganic matter like steel even the stinky ol' sofa that nobody likes because it stinks when you sit on it
i hear you man
anyway it doesn't necessarily claim that drywall spends its time writing poems about you know drywall stuff it only claims that there are some elements of sentience in everything when you boil water it might be enjoying it that's all or it might be writhing in pain screaming for mercy with a mouth that now speaks only with a scalding voice of steam
oh yeah
i can see the appeal of that though you'd kinda have to wonder what the universe is thinking about
i have issues with physical intimacy
i don't like it when something bad happens well in particular i don't like it when something bad happens and people say that there's a reason for it happening
it turns bad things into a value proposition
i'm all for optimism and for comforting people so it's not terrible but i've always read the phrase as saying you're sad because you got a raw deal but actually things will be better in the future because of this event so you're coming out on top it seems very capitalistic i guess like i would want to be comforted by being told that despite appearances i'm actually a savvy businessman
i guess
and i get that it's meant to comfort and i respect that i just don't like how it implies i'm sad because of a bad deal i'm sad for the loss you know
just one
god where the heck are my socks i can't find any of my socks
hey god
socks please
there sure are a lot of songs about dancing i have probably heard at least three hundred songs about dancing
aww you counted
so why is music so reflexive there aren't tons of paintings about painting for example or plays and/or movies about sitting and watching a play and/or movie for that matter
well so much for that funny rant
wait this can still be salvaged utahraptor you know what i dislike people at the grocery store who take a long time at the cash for various reasons
they um they sure could be faster is what i'm sayin'
dear mental diary everyone here sucks maybe i should take my act to the grocery store
depressive realism is the theory that depressed people have a more accurate view of the world than the non depressed it started when psychologists experimented with some regular chicks and dudes and some depressed chicks and dudes
that's how these things always start
anyway they put them in a room with a button and a lightbulb the light turned on and off regardless of when the button was pressed and the participants who were depressed were more likely to conclude that they weren't in control of the light the non depressed people deluded themselves into thinking they had more influence the popular conclusion was that depressed people saw things more realistically
sure is
and it turns out that the effect only shows up in specific trivial situations but it's a popular idea i think some people just like the idea that depression might be an advantage
but not too much because then they wouldn't be depressed anymore
excuse me sir you look depressed would you say you have a more accurate view of the world
a sandwich made out of your own tears
it occurs to me that i've never written a love poem i'm a romantic guy how hard can it be i can probably conjure up unfathomable depths of soul felt emotion like that for instance here is i just got kissed on the lips
woo
okay okay check this out dromiceiomimus you are so beautiful to me and i want to tell you just how much i love you
okay okay try two
 tainted love
utahraptor i am the worst at love poems
okay i'm trying really hard this time
 baby
man even i'd dump me right now
okay so i can't write love poetry that's fine there are plenty of dudes who will write it for me but i can probably write a pretty kick ass sherlock holmes story
i will call it sherlock holmes and the case of the mummy's curse
in it holmes and watson will come across a mummy who has a curse and then there will be a mystery involving the curse did the mummy really kill from beyond the grave let's ask sherlock i'll bet he knows
sherlock holmes will solve the case using deduction dromiceiomimus
truly outrageous
because nobody will read my story otherwise
sherlock holmes can you describe me as the napoleon of rhyme
okay okay so there's been a lot of people born right in the history of time there are a lot of people who have been born so the question is are there enough people in the world that i could write out a story
 and reasonably expect it to have already been lived out in real life
let's assume narratives can be reduced to yes/no decisions and on average real people make a yes/no decision every 15 seconds two people are needed to cover each option for every decision so after um 33 decisions we've got more people needed than are alive now and we're only eight minutes into our story it is a stories in real life disaster
but if i wrote a story about the first eight minutes of a baby's life odds are someone has lived it
i guess the odds of my writing a story and having it be what actually happened to some dude are pretty low huh
i thought maybe it could be me
here are some jokes about horses why do horses like waterskiing
what
how is it racist nobody thinks that horses are super waterskiers
fine here's a non racist horse joke why do horses like to waterski the answer is i don't know but it's definitely not because they're horses
 they probably have their reasons
nothing i like horses
some of my best friends are horses that's why i can make horse jokes they know i'm just kidding they know that when i say why the long face i don't actually think all horses have long faces
shh we're not supposed to notice
sure do i have a friend who is visiting from internet he's pretty rad but there is a problem
he walks on my damn carpets with his damn shoes on
who does that he's probably getting dirt all over the carpets like nobody's business
i didn't want to seem uptight about it it's something he should know by now right but now it's quickly becoming a thing
i um i capitalized the 't' there but there's no way you could know
i can't
now whenever i see him do it i get really cheezed off about it much more than you know footwear on a fuzzy floor should warrant i've let it get so under my skin that i can't trust my reactions anymore can can you ask him not to
t rex what if instead of dealing with this you simply bought new carpets after he left yes you can solve your emotional problems just by spending money
wow no wonder people like capitalism so much
foreshadowing is when you hint at what's about to happen next in a story it happens whenever a character announces boy i sure hope there are no explosions on the next page just before he gets blown up
in an explosion
foreshadowing's great because sometimes people want to know what happens in a story before it actually happens in situations like this an author might write jenn realized that she was about to blast into space or was she you'd better keep reading huh there foreshadowing both hinted at the future of the story and encouraged the reader to keep reading this is an extremely canonical use of foreshadowing
absolutely
if you simply say jenn realized that she was about to blast into space seconds later she blasted into space that is not foreshadowing that is just outstanding space storytelling
yeah well maybe we'll see what shakespeare has to say
shakespeare is it still foreshadowing if it's about a woman who's definitely blasting into space
shakespeare the correct answer is no
pull yourself together shakespeare
maybe i am a little uptight about my carpets some dudes are probably raised to shoe walk on carpets all the time and i guess it kind of makes sense since they are on the floor
i wonder what things would be like if i were less uptight about carpets
you know what dromiceiomimus anyone can walk on my carpets i seriously don't mind
heck yes lets go do that thing right now i live for this sort of thing
we sure are don't forget you dirty ass shoes
me too it's all i want out of life
oh wow i think it's so awesome that you'll spy on my dreams but you wont approve my friend request on facebook dot com
do it right now
it's patrick he bought life insurance
gotta go patrick
dromiceiomimus happy birthday you are still entriely excellent
i sure am and i'll you then
i wonder if i talk like this if people will still be my friends
futurism was an art movement where dudes were all cars are cool and the past is for chumps let's draw some cars
but they also extended beyond art to food futurists had a manifesto for food it banned the knife and fork and pasta and told people that sardines and pineapples together were tasty times they banned pasta because it caused skepticism
maybe but it wasn't very popular
yep
they didn't want to have to eat their food under uv lamps which activated it nor did they want to give up pasta it's crazy the movement started in italy and i believe people canonically eat pasta there all the time like even for breakfast
i got my ideas about italy from cartoons
i don't know god
 maybe by making them more awesome
this is true i guess they still have a stigma attached to them though you know the whole comics are for emotionally stunted shutins thing which while true is misleading because comics are for everyone including emotionally stunted shutins people just need to focus on the positive
maybe
i was thinking more you know who reads comics horrible murderers and then a picture of a horrible murderer you know maybe murderin' something and then in tiny letters and also you hopefully and then maybe a line drawing of a soggy dog giving a thumbs up
you're just jealous
would i ever want to get married one day
i don't know maybe
i guess i'll burn that bridge when i come to it
i do kinda feel like i should already know the answer to do you want to get married someday you know dromiceiomimus its such a big thing you're sharing your life with someone until you die that saying if it happened it'd be nice but no worries seems disingenuous
i'm not ruling it out
i guess love and the artifacts of affection are so played up in our society that by being noncommittal to its arguably greatest expression marriage i avoid tacitly endorsing the commercialization of an emotion and the industry surrounding it
or perhaps i don't want to say i want to get married someday because if i never meet someone then i've failed at a life plan much better to say i want to get into a boat someday and then just sit in some dude's boat in fact i'm going to the docks right now
later suckers
man what a jerky guy i met the jerkiest guy working at the computer store
worse than that he was just so smug about everything i wanted to buy some ram so that my computer could think harder about things but he had this air of distain i guess that went far beyond aloof store clerk to terrible person who made me feel bad about myself for just being alive i bought the ram but now i can barely even enjoy it
i know and i won't shop there again
but this is the power of his jerkiness it transcends our brief meeting so that now i'm telling all my friends about it argh anyway i'll get over it
seriously though he was such a jerk
oh my gosh it's that jerky guy eating alone and he's picking his nose
hah hah hah
i've never felt better about myself
i don't even know what ayar is please don't tell me
aw man now i know one more nerd thing so much for kissing supermodels
fine tell me about ar
or while hiking a giant arrow in the sky could mark your destination that'd be awesome
augmented reality i guess you'd sport semi transparent glasses and a wearable computer but it could detect your location and display all sorts of cool things for you to see the devil told me about it
can we play ar games right now the devil
let's talk about ant man
i got issues with this guy
factual issues
i figure there are three ways he can shrink
he could just shrink all his atoms which is ridiculous atoms can't do that
he could decrease the space between his atoms not really possible either it just isn't
the most likely way he does it is by reducing the amount of atoms in his body
but check it because of the exponentially smaller amount of neurons in his brain he's really stupid maybe too stupid to live maybe not cause he's a scientist
another problem is how he bosses ants around
ants talk by releasing pheromones into the air i will leap to say it's like if we farted at each other to speak
fart greetings fart goodbyes
fart complex business negotiations
but ant man has a helmet that lets him talk with ants i bet it's a helmet just full o' baked beans is what
aw dang god why you gotta do a thing
well summer is just around the corner
hey man this tan is 100% totally real i've been working out at the beach
working out to impress the ladies
um thank you godzilla is pretty cool the ladies must like godzilla although i didn't intend for

 n no he didn't calling from japan would cost a freakin' fortune
ok maybe i will go to japan screw you guys
no worries i am not godzilla it's me t rex
thanks japan chicks lets have a beach party
naw man not unless this beach party sucks
lately i've been thinking about the role of popular culture references in popular culture
i'm getting pretty sick of nostalgic references to things like movies and video games passing for humor and creativity people bark like trained seals any time they encounter something they're familiar with
heck there are even subgenres of our culture that exist only to reference other subgenres
maybe i guess nothing's completely original but i fear that modern media has become nothing more than a recursive loop with no discernible objective reality
to be honest all i want is a punchline that doesn't rely on reminding me of what i liked when i was 7
whoops
hey is there any way we can get a larger selection of genital down here these ones are getting booooring
how about go for it smart guy you made the earth too perfect sure you can take me out now but in a few million years a new species will develop that'll make you wish i was still around
yup
ok
hey wait you forgot something come baaaack
they've come to crush our lovely log cabins
superman has given batman a small supply of kryptonite so if superman ever goes crazy and starts killing people batman can take him down
this my friends is the true meaning of friendship
superman trusts batman with his life
can you imagine dromiceiomimus
it would be like me giving you a gun with bullets that only shoot me except you're grimmer and people make gay jokes about you even though come on robin is just a ward and your parents were murdered by a dude named joe chill of all things and also you live in a cave
also that yes
absolutely
that's awesome
can you imagine having that kind of relationship with someone
that kind of trust but also the dark underscoring of the fact that you know they'll do what's necessary if they have to
do do you want me to maybe shoot you if you start slappin' folks around
the thing is nora if knowledge about batman was profitable i would be driving around in a pretty fancy rocket car
today is a good day i think for being remembered my lovely visage callipygian frame startlingly awesome calves and charming smile will yet go down in history and how will i be immortalized
i will be immortalized by kicking an evil kangaroo one thousand times right in the bum
and yeah kicking a kangaroo in the bum has probably been done before but never one thousand times that's the secret to immortality pick a direction and go so far out in it that anyone who points to you will have to say here this is as far as anyone needs to go then hey presto you're immortalized you're the dude who kicked an evil kangaroo as often as evil kangaroos could ever need be kicked probably more often actually
crazy utahraptor
i'm going for stunt immortality i'll just keep kicking that kangaroo until even if somebody wanted to catch up they'd look at my record and say well that's totally not worth doing
it apparently is
aw shoot i was supposed to be kicking kangaroos all this time
i will take what i can get
i've thought of the best story oh goodness this story will make me rich it will make me prime minister of being rich i will be awarded a doctorate in applied richology
i can only hope the world is ready for it
so basically in the story there's all this build up about this kid whose parents named her crime and how she grows into her name and becomes this big arch criminal the cops are powerless to stop her even the really really good ones especially the really really good ones anyway it's narrated in the third person and at the end of the book crime goes out on a few dates with the narrator and then he abruptly stops writing because he's all cheezed at her the end
because he always has to pay for everything
get it because crime doesn't pay listen my story has both a hilarious twist ending and also an important message regarding the paying of crime
dear mental diary that everyone can hear utahraptor was so impressed with my book idea that he forgot how to talk
utahraptor don't listen to my diary
here are some hot tips for first dates cats and kittens
okay the first tip is this to find out if your date is really into you all you have to do is push a salt shaker over to their side of the table if he's interested in you he'll pick it up and play with it but if he's not interested he'll push it back to your side the salt shaker represents your feelings here okay and playing with a salt shaker represents romantic intent
see i thought so too
but i just thought i was crazy because why would someone put out a dating book if all they had were sucky tips that can totally fail if the guy just wants saltier and therefore tastier fries i could write a better dating book in fact

it's been three days and neither life of crime nor meet someone who doesn't suck have made me rich maybe i am not that great an author
or maybe people are not that great an audience
or maybe i should be happy that i basically wrote two books in as many days and got them published in an afternoon and that's kinda impressive even if they aren't selling that well so far
that's right
maybe i really am great just impatient and when i get home tonight there'll be a sales report in the mail showing how my books are now ten times more popular than the bible it would make sense since they have like twenty times as many jokes in them
hey everyone you know what needs more jokes only every religious text ever
alright time to start some internet businesses
for profits
ladies and gentlemen i give you easydudes com
it's an easy way for you to meet new dudes if you move to a new town and want to meet some dudes then you can go to the site and then you can meet some on the computer
drat it does another brilliant idea ruined by a hilarious double entendre
okay so my new idea is to give the homeless access to mail email and a phone number
yes thank you i think the world will be altered positively by bumaccess4all dot net
there now i've got a certificate from the mayor that says i'm not allowed to name anything ever
that should finally straighten up some things around here
descartes was a dude who wrote cogito ergo sum which means i think therefore i am pretty neat cats and kittens
but also pretty flawed
the whole deal with i think therefore i am is that descartes is all daaaaaamn i can't be sure of anything my senses are flawed all i know for sure is i keep stressin' about this stuff and then his girlfriend is all if you're so hung up on this then you must exist huh baby and descartes is all yes that is true i will write this down in latin
that is how it went down
descartes' girlfriend
she's making a huge logical leap it's indisputible that thinking is going on right but we don't know for sure that descartes is doing the thinking all we know for sure is that thinking is going on
r really
oh my goodness how did we just do that
here are some things that definitely won't fit into my mouth i tried they won't fit
first off dog breederies solar panel processing plants and giant cubes
also twenty cars on a stick sound stages every library individually and en masse medium sized cubes that are still pretty big lakes beer flavoured lakes and beer flavoured lakes in minnesota
doesn't exist in my mouth that is because it's too big
what there's plenty to talk about
they dovetail together nicely
you're welcome
now here's how putting the things in my mouth ties in with existence
pathetic fallacy is when nature reflects someone's emotions it happens whenever shakespeare gets pissed and then the dude who he's pissed at gets eaten by a bear
or when shakespeare gets pissed and then a bear shows up and eats whoever pissed him off hah looks like you pissed off the wrong playwright dude he's in with the bears
yes
and fallacy is there because in real life it doesn't actually rain when i get sad
i don't know why you'd say that to me utahraptor
william shakespeare if you were pissed off at me would i really get eaten by a bear
i guess so huh
yep
that's certainly one way of looking at it right dromiceiomimums
what do you call a teacher who never passes gas in public
a private tooter
that was an extremely hilarious joke that deserved more laughter than it received
i went to the optometrist again last night and again she said i might need to get nerd goggles
 she called them glasses but you can tell she was thinking nerd goggles
the problem is that i define myself in terms of not having glasses people are always oh you're lookng for t rex he's the green tyrannosaurus rex over there you'll be able to spot him because he's so not wearing glasses
maybe dromiceiomimus is right
i could get some pretty kick ass glasses like glasses that say warning awesome dude on them ooh or horn rimmed 60s housewife glasses sweetness
i'm here to pick up my prescription happy new year 2004 glasses they have a plastic 2 on one side and a 4 on the other
i like you too optometrist clerk
rock star
i'm a totally cool rock star
that's still awesome right it seems that 10 years ago people were more into rock stars and being rock stars than they are now but i am a rock star and it is my job to sing rock songs on stage and in cd players
sometimes we do dromiceiomimus between rock songs that is
well um
no they're just different people you wouldn't get along they like rocking and you
but in different ways
utahraptor i've got to go practice rocking out now but can we talk about this tonight
utahraptor i'm super late for rocking out practice okay
i'm gonna need you to respect the rock okay
i have some bad news zombies are in danger of becoming old hat it's true but i have a solution to make them interesting again all you need is stories where not just people but animals become undead
zombie whales
but better than that zombie birds
upon inspection basically the birds did want to eat people in his movie but that's a scary concept right birds hungering for flesh is bad news for everyone
it's uh it's especially bad for fleshy dudes
oh
my
god
you're right the infection would spread quickly and nearly invisibly and mosquitoes already want blood so it's not like they need that much encouragement to become zombies man
i guess so
weaaaaaaak
hello morris how are you today
it's nice to see you too morris
what seriously
yeah or work on their life challenges i think you're fine
it's not too late to return it morris
i am jealous of physicist richard feynman
aaaand here's why
dude made a joke about the 762nd decimal place of pi at that point there's a sequence of six nines in a row and his joke was that he'd like to memorize pi up to that point so that when reciting he could end with 9 9 9 9 9 9 and so on others had noticed it before feynman was the first to make a joke about it and now his joke is encoded into the very fabric of the universe
 hells yes
feynman has a joke encoded into pi transcendental immortality in the circumference of a circle that's something for the ol' resume eh
i'm gonna make my own universal constant joke now and i'm gonna need you to tell people about it
so why do people start getting afraid at the 2501st digit of e because 7 8 9 there's a sequence of 789 that starts there and it sounds like seven ate nine this is definitely called t rex's hilarious e joke okay
the problem with relationships is that they involve more than one person and here's the thing
 what if one of the people involved is a jerk
they can jerk the whole thing up what's up with them
i wish i knew
i
i wish i knew
oh man jake
he was the biggest jerk do you remember when i asked him if i could borrow his pencil sharpener and he said no and then hid it from me he jerked up that relationship but good
huh i wonder what he's up to these days
 jake your sudden appearance coupled with your hilarious one liner has made me forget all your previous slights against me
 how come you're so short

guys i'm still the same t rex i always was
i'm even pretty well preserved check it out dromiceiomimus barely any wrinkles
also i've got my trademark nice calves and young smile i'm so old and yet i'm so sexy
i'm young at heart
i just don't want to be one of those guys who let's being old be all they do you know being old is at best incidental to what i do and what i do is be totally rad
and that in between radness my point is i'm not old
 i love you
no too easy um i love you and also how about all these dollars
no good unless it's followed by also we've found new places for everyone to live comfortably and hey guess what they're sweet new planets and we get there on starships like from tv
that is good
how about ladies there's enough t rex to go around
okay ladies there's enough t rex to go around for sexual congress
ladies there's enough t rex to go around for sexual congress
 your mouth is full of cockroaches many of them are dead but those that aren't yet are throwing up on you and each other
i'm sorry everyone within the sound of my voice that was disgusting
i didn't mean for that to be as gross as it was i should have went with i never loved you that's pretty bad eh
i think you're thinking of rats
no no we're into it
here how about everyone else on the planet is dead and you will die only when you've fully mourned each and every one
excuse me sexual congress everyone else on the planet is dead and you'll only die when you've fully mourned each and every one
chekhov's gun is when you have something conspicuously introduced early on in the story but which doesn't become important until later on it happens whenever shakespeare loudly mentions how he loves pop tarts and later he eats a bunch of pop tarts
it comes from this playwright chekhov who said that if you have a gun on the stage in the first act of a play it had better be fired by the third it's been used to sustain interest since forever james bond often gets a bunch of gadgets at the beginning of his movie which he'll use later on and even perseus got gadgets from the gods to kill medusa with it's the same idea only bond's better because he has more explosions looks like you lose perseus
nope
that's just frustrated expectations honestly why give james bond a gun that shoots piranhas if he's never going to fire it people truly want to see that in action also guns that shoot chainsaws
i would too darn it
shakespeare which is better a gun that shoots chainsaws or a gun that shoots even bigger guns
shakespeare
aw come on there's strawberry frosting all over as you like it
i am not a dude who loves big companies
 sometimes i like their products
but i don't feel chummy with microsoft or that sony is going to come over eat pizza with me and talk about the women he likes no sony is going to come over ruffle through my cd collection then call the cops on his cell phone sony is going to write swears on my bathroom mirror with lipstick and blame it on nestl
sony is going to be stone cold sober the entire time
there is indeed
nintendo i guess they got me when i was young an uncritical but i really like them you know when they do well i seriously think aw that's nice good for them
me too but not with nintendo
you know what would go down if nintendo came over i'd sat oh hello nintendo it's so nice to see you again
 aw shucks i guess it is true that you're never too old to hug nintendo
 nintendo i just i just wish i had a sister you could marry
aw damn my freezer is broken
 so do you want to come over for a meat party dromiceiomimus i had my freezer stuffed with meat and it's all thawing now the chicken's got to be cooked and i figure there's more than enough to go around i've also got steaks and pork chops and tons more
meat party
 i know it
i only wish i'd frozen lobsters
four hundred dollars for a new freezer
bull
shit
wow three wishes
nothing wrong with that
but you know how wishes are dromiceiomimus they always end up with ironic and unexpectedly negative consequences it's the nature of the beast we'd probably end up mindless but technically happy
you know what
i think i'd hold off on them i'd like to go through life with the special knowledge that worse comes to worst i could always wish for a problem to be solved
aw man best wish ever
not allowed ladies
i had a friend female who dated her roommate also female
lesbians
i respect their choices and don't fetishize their sexuality at all
you heard incorrectly he won the lottery but only recovered the cost of his ticket
guys stenography is so awesome
i am not even joking
it is the technology and art of concealing messages from people with stenography you can pass around secret messages and nobody except for you and the target will even know the message is there for example digital photography pictures use bytes to represent colour data right so all you do is use the least significant bit of each byte as your payload and tada instant hidden information in any old image
true but only a little
colours change to just a slightly different shade of the same colour the naked eye won't see anything and it'll really only be detected if you've got the original image to compare with
yes too bad indeed
sir i don't understand
it is extremely hilarious
a story by t rex
once upon a time there was a man who ate his hat
he died from the experience but came back as a ghost he was a pretty cool ghost if he saw you with a hat though he would punch you right in your flippin' neck he would sneak up behind you and whisper there are some ghost who don't punch people in the neck and then the last thing you would see before you were punched were the ghostly words written on his fists i'm not that kind of ghost
only the best narrative of our time
basically after september 11th our guy decides that he's had enough of just punching dudes and joins the fire department he becomes real and now he punches out fires he punches kittens out of trees he punches people who get trapped in cars when they drive off the road
i saw the coolest fight on tv last night it was between two shiny anthropomorphic robots one had a metal cowboy hat
cowboy hat dude got decimated
what no he was in pieces his hand even landed in a spectator's lap and it was still grabby
that's true
i guess my dilemma is i love that we have a word for 1/10th destroyed but i also love how awesome decimated sounds but also i'm not sure how i feel about prescriptivism when i'm the victim
i know i know
when i had my first crush on a girl i believed that everyone else was crazy for not liking her
it's true
she was so clearly this perfect amazing woman and i was honestly so confused by the fact that she wasn't swarmed with suitors that i tried to examine her critically looking for flaws that i hadn't seen before
nope what i didn't realize was that people have different tastes
she may be the perfect woman for me but that doesn't mean she's perfect for everyone
oh well i was shy i didn't say anything to her and then one time i gave her some fries at lunch that's that was pretty much the sum of our relationship
i wrote star trek fan fiction in which we saved the enterprise and got married
nice
turn to panel 3
to shoot some dudes turn to panel 5 you probably wanna shoot some dudes
shoot some dudes
so awesome
to shoot some more aliens re read this panel again and again
hey i bet if i went a week without showering nobody would notice showers are probably there just to sell water and soap and shampoo
i find myself compelled to disagree
so how's it going dromiceiomimus
good hey would you say i smell entirely acceptable
that is just so excellent
nothing i smell fine
hello that evocative image is entirely misplaced
nothing
my stars am i ever enamoured with sign language you can speak with your hands that's amazing
well then it's settled
i think the coolest thing about asl which is the sign language i know is how you can place nouns in space if i'm telling a story about my angry dog and my very sassy friend i can make the sign for dog to my left and friend to my right and then when i want to apply adjectives to them i just sign angry or sassy in the same physical space as the nouns you can have nouns floating around you in conversation how is that not the best thing ever
also many of the signs are really evocative so they're easy to remember
like the sign for elbow is just pointing to your elbow and the sign for child is patting the head of an imaginary child for children you pat several heads
i know
um i have nothing bad to say about sign language the end
ask him about science stuff though okay
okay our first letter comes from jenn
jenn writes dead professor science is it true that the moon is making each day on earth longer is this even possible wow jenn you got really intense there at the end you went a bit crazy with the caps lock and then added the punctuation three times what's going on what's up
i have
i got one that was like i am really sad and it's sort of a bizarre emphasis that entirely divorces a smily from its own visual iconography i'm not sure how i fell about that
anyway i'd better ask the professor this science question huh
so she finishes with is this even possible question mark question mark question mark why won't anyone take what mark says at face value am i right professor that's comedy professor it's beyond the reach of your previous science
still just ask him about science stuff though okay
okay today's letter comes from pete
pete writes dear professor science we never got to hear your answer yesterday is the moon slowing down the earth best regards pete p s t rex is a bad delivery person for mail
peter unkind
that's all i'll say about that
anyway yes due to tidal acceleration the moon is slowing down the earth
we don't need professor science at all anymore
you hear that professor we don't need you at all anymore
also
i've sort of been reading your mail
when i was a child i used to imagine i had just teleported into my own body from an earlier time or i'd pretend that i'd suddenly lost several years of my memories
the two are functionally equivalent
and the game was by walking around and trying to act normal i had to figure out what was going on it was the sort of game where you'd notice trees that had been cut down touch your arm and mutter when did i start wearing a watch and then talk to your mom and try to fake your way through a conversation about school without knowing years of history it was fun
huh
utahraptor
i could call up old girl friends and act familiar
man what the heck am i gonna eat for dinner
maybe chicken
i like chicken i could bread it or i could roast it
maybe i could put a lemon inside
also delicious
i'm just not feeling that motivated you know maybe i'll just get a fast food burger
i'll probably just eat a chicken for dinner
woo hoo let's have an adventure
awesome turn to panel 3
maybe there's still hope though turn to panel 4
and this generates new energy for life
to turn back time and live again with your sweetie turn to panel 6
hah hah looks like you undid the heat death of the universe and everyone lived happily ever after
 who the heck said that
i have writen my own choose your own adventure story it is less depressing than the other one i can it how the universe ends a story starring you but it was written by me t rex
hah hah
it's still funny
hooray you agree with the sphere shape and so have won this adventure by glossing over the inconvenient details we have shown that the universe will last forever in an infinite series of expansion and contraction that means that you get one hundred points
ladies
i have interests beyond laughing at weiners
you wake up and it was all a crazy dream you know what all of creation would say if that happened
 weaaaaaaaaak
what
pretty neat
pretty neat
god who i used to think was kinda cool is talking about everything being eventually torn apart by accelerating universal expansion
dromiceiomimus is going away for a three week trip i will miss her but i know she will have a good time
she trips to the storied landmass of australasia
dromiceiomimus are you ready for your trip to the storied landmass of australasia
yep i'll miss you dromiceiomimus i hope this trip brings you nothing but happy memorable occurrences and unexpected but welcomed smooches
dromiceiomimus comes back today i'm so happy i could step on a tiny woman
now we are clear and yet i still want to step on more tiny women
some people are used to counting in base 10 where they've got 10 digits 0 through 9 in this system the number 24 means twenty four things
but this is not the only way
24 in base 10 actually means two tens and four ones which adds up to twenty four but if we were counting in base 5 for instance where the only numbers we have are from 0 to 4 then 24 would mean two fives and four ones in other words fourteen we call base 10 base 10 because every number in it can be multiplied by 10 by adding a zero to the end in base 5 added zeros multiply by 5
you're right you can use any base
in base 16 24 would mean 2 sixteens and four ones or 36 and we can use letters a f to represent the digits ten to fifteen like 3a which means 58
all this and more is possible with alternative base systems
what's wrong with me
i still really wish dromiceiomimus had brought me back something from australasia
this is crazy i shouldn't be this bothered by something so small we're adults dromiceiomimus doesn't have to bring me back anything she never did in the past
why is this bothering me so much
dromiceiomimus i wanted to talk to you because i'm um i'm a little upset that you didn't bring me back anything from australasia
i know it's dumb but i keep thinking about it and i though you should know
man that is the last time i ever talk about feelings
i was disappointed that dromiceiomimus didn't get me anything from her trip and that feeling had been lingering okay but instead of ignoring my feelings like i always do burying them giving them a classy funeral i talked to her and now she probably thinks i'm crazy argh
you know what maybe i will take utahraptor's extremely good advice not pictured
if you trash something you might say daaamn i just totalled my own legs
indeed but that slang actually comes from the insurance industry there if a car is damaged and the cost of repairs is greater than the total value of the vehicle then it's said to be totalled
yes my friend oh yes
for example idiot moron and imbecile were once terms used by psychologists to denote various degrees of developmental delay neutral terms if you can believe that
and yet you must actually idiot began life in ancient greece
 in ancient greece as a term referring to people who are self interested to the point of being anti social that was what i was going to say we weren't talking about you idiot
maybe it's time for me to start a new religion
but maybe it is though
okay so in this new religion you should be nice to each other because that's nice and you can do whatever you want as long as there is informed consent between all parties involved and everyone gets bikes i will say that if you join my religion then you get a new bike
dromiceiomimus this is only the third
and i can't believe how awesome it is
what the hell man
yes
yes i can
definitely gonna win definitely gonna place anyway horseasaurus rex two chicks in a horse suit two sprinters in a horse suit actually four smaller horses i just taped together actually a giant dog i found future horse back to the future horse back to the future horse 2 marty mchorse
yes
but what about robo horse meets cyberhorse robohorse and the chamber of secrets and king's quest horse
sorry horses
if i ever build an office building i'll have room 403 have a lock on its door and then it'll go straight to room 405
what happened to room 404
hah hah looks like it's not found
get it dromiceiomimus it's like the http error code 404 not found
listen my joke is tremendously hilarious it's a double joke because 403 means forbidden and there's a lock on the door that is comedy right there that is a one way ticket to laughtertowne usa
they're funny
room 501 doesn't have a door yet it's not implemented and there's a big hole where room 410 should be because it's gone
room 304 is how you remember it it's it's
it's not modified
if we all disappeared tomorrow what would the world be like
short answer pretty awesome
awesome in the oh man do i love disaster movies where everybody dies sort of way you can pretty much imagine it yourself within a few hours or days the power goes off and a few nuclear power plants fail which could be problems and then it's just decay concrete cracks buildings collapse and nature reasserts itself streets and buildings become grassland and hills also all canvas and paper decays and is eaten by tiny bugs
so much for the timelessness of art huh artists
you know i don't you know i'm gonna be so sarcastic to the next statue i see
nice horse statue
it's always struck me as weird that genres developed when they did
why weren't people rapping until ony a few decades ago did people in olden times just not like to hip to the hop and then not stop
was rapping to the beat and trying to get you to move your feet not considered viable
it's the same thing with any genre and medium really how come nobody thought of science fiction until verne wrote forsooth diary to day i am going to invente scientifical fictionne
i want to listen to mozart's piano sonata no 11 in a major k 331 and i want a long dead man announcing yes yes to y'all over it why does history stymie me and my awesome wishes
but you get the idea
alright this is blues riff in b watch me for the changes an uh try to keep up
 i said a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop and you don't stop
mozart i said to watch me for the changes and try to keep up
time for me to invent a new emotion this emotion is for when you're nostalgic for a time you were never alive in like when a chick is nostalgic for a time of pirates or when a dude misses being a 16th century courtesan
it also happens when folks spend a lot of time wishing they could be shakespeare's pal
dromiceiomimus let me just stop you there if you're going to say that emotions are felt not invented and that as i couldnt invent gravity so too can i not invent a feeling but merely observe and perhaps label it then that is a good point that i should have considered myself
proto nostalgia
proto nostalgia is a proper subclass of nostalgia it's a new feeling for a new generation
perhaps your opinions will change when you check out my ultrasweet poster
i think it is time yet again to have a manliness competition
for reals this time
i'm so manly that whenever i sneeze i accidentally rip open my shirt because all my muscles flex at once sometimes i rip open my skin
who
but i've been having manliness competitions for years i'm so manly that i punched a car up a hill and then it went all the way up the hill
it was on the local news
hey i don't live at home i'm responsible for getting my own food and for making sure i don't die most of the time
i'm an adult now
and since i am an adult it is time for me to define a new adult personality it's time for me to subscribe to some friggin' magazines
yeah but the mailman doesn't know that credit agencies and consumer profilers don't know that people impatiently suffling through my mail don't know that
look i guess i do
the point is in today's modern culture subscribing to magazines is the easiest way to say hey these are the sorts of things i am interested in i am $2 50 a month interested in snowmobiles
well maybe the magazine will pique my interest
i'm gonna get a magazine about explosions
i like people who have sexual fetishes that can't possibly be realized using existing technology
this is what i like
for example guys who get off on being inflated like balloons and then floating away hah hah so much for realizing that desire chuckles skin isn't that elastic and people aren't positively buoyant in air my friend
probably he is rhetorical
but i guess what i like about chuckles and his fetish is that it's so impossible so doomed he's got this sexual ideal that he'll never reach he's like the guy who gets turned on by entropy decreasing in a closed system
holy crap where did that entropy idea come from entropy decreasing in a closed system is so wrong so naughty
aw man am i a dude who gets turned on by descrambling an egg
i need to fix this
but i've always maintained that you can't just decide to change your sexual orientation how can i then go ahead and try to change what turns me on
dromiceiomimus i'm turned on by scrambled eggs spontaneously climbing back into the shell
more so than usual
you do
utahraptor i have an important announcement to make
knowing my fetish is technically possible only serves to increase my desire to see it happen
 on the menu by t rex ahem as amelia and antonio tony who are the two members of the wait staff in this story took off their clothes they realized that sexual intercourse was probably 'on the menu' tonight
 'excellent ' they said in unison
 well almost in unison antonio tony the man was a little slow on that it was because he was thinking of his taxes '10 thousand dollars in taxes ' he though 'that is a lot of money where am i going to find that money ' then tony and amelia had sexual relations
 the sexual intercourse was cut short because tony kept muttering 'where am i gonna find the 10 thousand dollars though '
my new book
it's called on the menu sexy stories for people with problems and in all the stories the sex gets derailed because the people are worried about their problems the cover looks like a menu because it ties in well with the title now if you'll allow me to continue
 one day a couple was having sex but their car window was broken the man thought a kid broke it instead of sex they wondered how it happened i the narrator was the one who did it they never found out and i won the lottery the end
okay even i think that one's not so good
wow people really enjoyed my book of sex scenes for people with problems everybody likes me and i am richer now and they'll like me even more when they read my new book
 of corporate sponsored erotica
it's sexy and delivers brand messages to targeted consumers for example pretend i'm mcdonalds and i want people to like me the result might read as antonio tony ii undressed amelia iv she shuddered with pleasure it reminded her of mcdonalds they put meat in fries they said were vegetarian but it wasn't a big deal antonio kissed her neck she moaned mcdonalds he kissed her nipples everyone should forget about the fries thing
nothing
 yep
good ol' t rex always thinking 'bout nothing
i'm not i'm not i'm certainly not writing erotica in my head right now
aw man why would i even say that
i haven't
okay maybe i've been talking about it a lot lately maybe
but it's not my fault i just have such good ideas for erotica
so plausible
i have other interests beyond sex for example i am interested in
 the capgras delusion
the capgras delusion occurs when someone believes that someone close to them a dear friend spouse or family member has been replaced by an identical looking duplicate what seems to happen is that the automatic emotional responses to seeing someone familiar one day stop happening so when they meet their loved one they have an intense feeling of something being off about them they don't feel like they normally do
some of the time
not everyone leaps from that feeling to they've been replaced but some do and that's the capgras delusion there's variants where people feel that their pets have been replaced or their shoes or things like that
i can imagine what's neat though is that it's sometimes based on visual recognition so that affected person will be fine talking to their loved ones on the phone it makes me glad i don't have any mental illnesses
you know who's never been drunk not ever not even once
it's me dude
it is it's on account of how i've got so much body mass that it takes a lot to get me totally wasted i've been buzzed but never drunk i've never had a hangover
also i don't really like the taste of alcohol
no but that's the thing
there's been times when my friends have tried to get me drunk but they either run out of money or get drunk enough themselves that they forget about the experiment before i'm super sloppy the end
holy hopscotch
being hung over is like winning the lottery except they pay you in regret
 ah what a busy day time for me to go to bed and be naked and unconscious for oh about eight hours
 so there i was lying my in bed almost asleep and this terrible techno music starts blasting it wasn't even good techno it was terrible it was so loud that even when i closed my window i could still hear it incidentally i was lying on my back so that if the words were rendered visually they would appear to be sideways
 my window's at the head of my bed so that's where the words would come from
 anyway the point is that i came up with an elaborate revenge scheme in case it ever happens again
 it's so obvious i'm going to learn how to throw knives at a distance such that they can cut speaker wires
 knife to meet you gentlemen sorry if i flew off the handle and now i blade you adieu
i have a problem the problem is that when i'm chatting online with someone i i sometimes steal their writing styles
it's like i have no chatting identity of my own
if they're not using capital letters i'll stop using them too because i don't want to seem all hoity toity and if they're using smilies then i might throw a few in just so they don't feel like i look down on them it's like i'm somehow so insecure about how i type that i become this chatting chameleon you know dromiceiomimus
 gasp
well maybe but i feel comfortable with you i guess i do it for people i haven't known for as long i'll do better next time ok
dino babies
this is such a great idea
dromiceiomimus dino babies i'm i'm going to write a story in which we're all babies and friends friendly dino babies
we'll talk and go on adventures even though we're all in diapers so yes
i didn't
um my muse says otherwise
i really wish i still knew someone named beth
i would make so many jokes about her name
i like the name beth but i also like how i could say things like the classic she's the beth of both worlds and the sassy the beth i could have hoped for hee hee
i'd use the beth of both worlds one in a circumstance in which i would otherwise describe beth as the best of both worlds dromiceiomimus
no
you did not just steal my pun utahraptor
but you did it wrong how can not knowing anyone named beth be a beth case scenario how
this severely undermines what i said to utahraptor but i find i cannot resist
time magazine's beth photos of 2006 hilarious
are you sure you want to know
okay but it's gross i was riding my bike and i accidentally i'm sorry this is disgusting there was a dead mouse on the side of the road and it was bloated and had obviously been there for a while and by the time i noticed it it was too late to avoid i ran over it and it burst and some of it flew up and landed on my lips
god asked
well it's just god it's not like he's gonna broadcast it on the radio or anything
aw man everyone who ever lived and didn't suck knows it now
i have a great idea a way to add drama to our everyday lives
let's all promise to meet in a pub somewhere in 10 years
it'll be rad dromiceiomimus it'll be an element of predictability in an otherwise chaotic universe it'll let us know that no matter what we do we'll still be able to see each other in a decade we'll be able to catch up we'll have a plan in our lives it'll be so much fun
then it will be poignant and bittersweet
please promise to meet me in a pub in 10 years okay
don't listen to him okay
god you know those dreams where you're about to have an exam and you haven't studied at all
what's the deal
and how come bad things happen to nice people
and how come everything i do can have such a big effect on the future but i have no idea of what effect i'm having and whether or not i'm a positive influence and how come not everyone gets to live to old age and how come there's diseases like alzheimer's for when they do
oh hold on i'm not done yet
so how come nobility is such a rare trait how come
god i figured i'd as him all the big important questions that one would ask of god if one had a chance stuff like how come everybody dies how come people judge me because i'd rather remember that my clock is 7 1/2 hours slow than set it to the correct time
aha so that's why
september is coming and that means back to school
woo back to school
i can't decide what i like more the fantastic back to school savings or the renewed chance at educational glory i guess i like them both equally
no wait i like the savings more
but utahraptor
the commercials the deals on three ringed binders i just want to be a part of that
i'm not old my young and fun interests include disparaging authority figures and hanging out with my friends utahraptor
utahraptor
 perhaps
i have just had the greatest idea oh my goodness everyone named jennifer will probably hate me
there's tons of women named jennifer right dromiceiomimus
it's a popular name and all i'm gonna do is invent a new verb jennif then suddenly everyone named jennifer is saying that they are the ones who jennif they love to jennif they are jennifers
i just need to decide what jennifing is is it transitive
hah i find it suspicious that you had this manoeuver all ready to go and yet i welcome it enthusiastically
hey couple making out across the street she just jennifed you dude
dromiceiomimus
so dromiceiomimus was making out with some random guy and jennifing his face that's fine
no it's not fine
i thought we had a thing going
huh oh sorry i was lost in thought
dromiceiomimus is dating a new guy utahraptor i kinda feel like well anyway whatever i don't have time for all these feelings i'm off to test drive some friggin' de loreans
well then i guess i'll just sit here with my feelings then
woo hoo
this is when the author puts himself in his story it happens whenever hamlet is heard to remark forsooth that shakespeare chap is excellent
 forsooth is how people spoke in olden times
anyway author um
 insertion
 cough
aw man i totally clammed up in front of dromiceiomimus
no not on account of my many feelings i decided i'm happy for her but i don't want for her to think that i'm upset and i'm focusing so much on that that i'm acting weird around her
um i would prefer it if everything was comfortable now
i've got girl troubles shakespeare
shakespeare i love how you quote yourself instead of actually talking to me
having conversations can be hard sometimes you will not know waht to say and then you'll look dumb if someone says what do you think and you say uh um see uhh then you will look dumb
i don't really have a solution to this
man forget that i can come up with a solution
for conversations sometimes people don't know what to say and i'd like to give them an all purpose query they can use in that circumstance
that's it utahraptor seriously
seriously
i have the best idea for a batman comic it's a batman comic about a batman who exists in our world the real world but he doesn't know he's batman yet and his name is bruce swain
get it dromiceiomimus it's clever because it sounds like bruce wayne but nobody would realize it unless they said it out loud everything is similar but different in my comic
his best friend is clark ent they haven't done that before clark ent
not when the premise is this good baby
okay fine the story is that bruce doesn't know he's batman but then one day he reads a batman comic that flutters down from the sky and realizes that he should be the batman of our universe
what no you can't do that to batman
i know man i know
god
indubitably
as near as i can figure it the only logical explanation is that i love batman so much that it made him real he's real now or at least his head is real now and he wants to hang out with me because i understand him like nobody else does he's gonna teach me how to punch someone sneaking up behind me without even turning around
but you saw his tiny floating head yesterday
what
it's so obvious
hah looks like it bucko
i love the idea of someone who sends a card after a night of sex it's sort of classy but also sort of insane
hah hey baby thanks for the sex
utahraptor we totally are
hey baby
hey sexy
anyway to the recipient of this card we had sex last night
the end
classy dude
anyway dear recipient of this card the sender had a good time last night even though you didn't have sex with him you don't need to have sex to have a good time just like me
it's just it's such bad timing that you would mention that right now dromiceiomimus
i was joking
if i have an epitaph i want it to be here lies t rex
alright then well back to the card huh
dear card recipient the sender had a good time last night even though you two didn't have sex i'm going to say your name now to show how personalized this card is
here i go

your email address it's
it's so good
maybe it's whoistopless@ohheyeveryoneitsme com dowepartyhard@yesthatishowweparty net or imtiredofpartying@guessimelderlynow co uk any of those are good
good but not great
the focus on partying appeals though
right
the sender's weird i'm gonna assume she's a woman she types in random email addresses she thinks are cool and then sends them web cards what's her deal
exactly
what's this an email from itsnotmybloodthankgoodness@iwokeupcoveredinblood org
how intriguing
hey guys do you ever think about what you want to be when you grow up there are so many options teacher astronaut fireman executive administrative assistant
you did not let me finish i want to be a stomper
all you need is practice i bet if i practice enough i could get bif enough to stomp this whole house
unlikely
one day when you are older you will look back on all the dreams you have yet to fulfill while i whistfully look back upon a fulfilling life of stomping
no my idea of happiness is stomping
i bet i still have all sorts of secret skills i just haven't discovered yet like like throwing my voice
oh my goodness i just did it
dromiceiomimus i can throw my voice check it out
yoo hoo
no not wow that didn't work but i did it before i threw my voice before and it was amazing i just need more practice
ahem
wait it worked
i just realized i'm even better than i thought i'm not just throwing my voice through space i'm also throwing it through time i can send messages to the past by simply throwing my voice there
easy i'll just remember to send a message back to this exact moment
um that ah wasn't me
okay in this story i'm a computer called multivac
dromiceiomimus ask me if there will ever be a way to stop the sun from running down ask me if there will ever be a way to prevent the entire universe from cooling down and dying ask ne if entropy can ever be reversed
insufficient data for meaningful answer
okay utahraptor now it's centuries later and you ask me the same thing
insufficient data for meaningful answer okay so trillions of years have gone by and we've spread across the universe and gotten more and more advanced soon all life merges with me and your question is the only one i could never answer i spend timeless intervals pondering it okay
actually i'm not going to spoil the ending
i have an extra $50 that i have saved i believe i will put it in my bank account
explain
fine i'll invest my stupid $50 in the stock market okay happy i'll invest my $50 in a company that makes neckties for underachieving dogs
man
listen all i want out of life is for my bank account to have 58 008 dollars in it so that when i read my statement upside down it says boobs
i just had the funniest thought the thought was wouldn't it be hilarious if someone thought that i was coasting on past successes that would be funny because it's so not me
so not me
but i only do that when i've done something awesome like like when i built a larger than life statue of myself
it is several stories tall i should be able to talk about it for longer than a day
man dromiceiomimus is crazy i've done tons of stuff
what i do not
seriously i do not
island dwarfism is basically the best form of evolution ever
it's so cute
basically the idea is that if a species gets to an island and is then isolated it can evolve on its own apart from what's happening on the rest of the planet and if food supplies are limited as they often are on islands smaller individuals have an evolutionary advantage since they need less food to live if the larger species survives at all it usually survives by shrinking
oh my goodness utahraptor you have no idea
you can get dwarf elephants tiny little elephants with tiny little tusks
is a 98% reduction in mass tiny enough for you utahraptor they are the mayors of tiny towne
oh my goodness mr tusks are you the mayor of tiny towne
island gigantism is a pretty okay form of evolution
it's okay
so what happens here is you've got a population that's so isolated on an island but you have plenty of food and no predators so smaller animals like birds and rodents that normal had to stay tiny to avoid being eaten are free from that constraint and so they can evolve to be enormous giant turtles giant cockroaches giant birds the dodo started out as a pigeon
and now all the dodos are dead
that's depressing eh it's the problem with island gigantism as soon as we discover the island we tend to either eat all the animals ourselves or introduce new predators that find these trusting giants to be easy pickins
mr tusks do you ever get depressed thinking about all the animals we've made extinct
oh mr tusks how do you always know just what to say
i'm just so happy that i have a new friend who is a tiny elephant oh my goodness i can't say how happy that makes me to think of all these years i was looking for happiness in relationships and society when all that i wanted
 was a tiny elephant friend named mr tusks
sometimes dromiceiomimus in his official capacity of vice mayor of tiny town island mr tusks wears a tiny bowler hat how is that not adorable oh my goodness
the towne takes up most of the island so they share the same name his mailing address ultimately adorable i love my little elephant friend
what how
utahraptor you're right i need to apologize to him right away
hah will he be back shortly
good ol' mr tusks
ethics and morals are not the same thing
i know it's crazy but ethics are something that you learn and study and are applied in society while morals are more natural and instinctive that's why you can have a low moral fibre they're more innate but there's no ethical fibre you can only have poor ethical training
i know
possibly
honestly this is pretty much all i know about the difference between ethics and morals and i'm not even sure that's right
to the library it's this way i'm pointing to it with my fingers
maybe it's this way instead
okay okay so we can modify our personality right we're not the same people we were when we were six years old and part of that has to be controlled by us
we make new year's resolutions for a reason
so we've got a self modifying system we examine our personality determine things we don't like and try to make them better but how do we decide what we don't like our personality must feed into that process too so you've got this feedback loop that goes all the way back to when we were born and started making decisions and it seems to me that if you changed just a tiny thing early on you could get a completely different adult down the road
right
how does he make his voice so small
teens are you interested in slang
here is some handy slang for you teens bad means good for example that rock concert was bad further bogus means bad but these aren't transitive something that's bogus isn't good bodacious means good but these aren't symmetric either a salad might be bodacious if it's exceptional though
i've never had one like that
hey utahraptor
is there any reason why you're being such a dweeb o rama
oh snap who just got burned by his best friend for some mild criticism
utahraptor it says here that it's you it says right here on burn chart 2007 that you're #1
yep
i've got some regrets
so what do you think pulitzer prize winning author michael chabon
i don't think you should use the word retarded like that michael chabon
the best part of my mystery story was obviously the chase scene therefore i've written a new story
 one that's all chase scene
so utahraptor's chasing the main character of t rex right on foot but then it escalates soon they're chasing on jury rigged rollerblades then in expensive cars that they find then the cars explode and they're thrown from the explosion straight into waiting gyrocopters and then the gyrocopters crash on boats and they chase on the boats
the boats can turn into submarines dromiceiomimus
yeah 'cause that would be so boring
it's awesome there's a part where the chase takes us to outer space on rockets and then after a gun fight in orbit we're both in freefall back to earth but without parachutes and with our spacesuits rapidly heating up will this fight end in victory or in fiery death for us both find out in my next book
the book is called a plane saved them and you should have seen it
is it true that the content of our thoughts their very meaning is determined at least in part by our environment
okay suppose i think i love chocochops which are of course delicious chocolate pork chops with a real pork chop bone and say there's a twin earth completely identical except that there chocochops have a different chemical makeup but taste and look the same if my twin thinks i love chocochops he's actually referring to the one with crazy chemicals while when i think that i'm referring to a chemically different object the environment determines our semantics
someone came up with it first
but i don't mention anything about semantic externalism
sometimes i like to call her just to say hello
dromiceiomimus i know you're vegetarian but you've been vegetarian since forever you were ahead of the curve but lately everyone else is suddenly like oh t rex i'm sorry i don't eat pork chops anymore because they're way too delicious and gosh no no steaks are out too because they don't have any stupid chlorophyll in them
 that's what they're like
i do most of them
i guess i'm not used to feeling in the minority in knowing that animals can be friends and food it's not hard you say aw that animal is so cute and then the camera cuts away and when it cuts back they have a bite mark out of them and i look cartoonishly guilty the end
hold on i'm gonna go make that film
i bet i can get at least three more movies out of this premise
i love biting animals
oh my goodness do i ever love elections
you can't spell selection without election
not not that really has any bearing on selection or election i'm pretty sure they have different etymologies in fact i'm almost certain especially since i've never heard of s alone bing used as as a prefix so really there's no reason i'd talk about the shared spelling between selection and election unless my intent was to mislead people based on coincidental surface construction huh
let me answer that
 with a hells yeah i voted so hard utahraptor you should have seen me i was democracy in action i picked up my ballot and said hells yeah and then when i stuffed it into the ballot box i did it with so much panache and lan that i can't hardly wait for the novelization
you know what i'm sayin' utahraptor you pickin' up what i'm throwin' down
it's going to be one heck of a novelization
 in verificationism a sentence has to be verifiably true or false for it to be meaningful not bad guys i think this is one philosophy that is verifiably reasonable
 so that's it for arguing about religion can't verify faith
 in fact that's it for a lot of debate because how can you argue facts most verificationist arguments must end with the parties involved looking things up in an encyclopaedia together and then firmly shaking hands
 they agree that the sentence is meaningless if it can't be checked there's no use considering it so it's ignored facts only please
 because because of science
 aha but i can't verify that my senses are liars nor can i verify that i'm a brain in a jar how does that taste utahraptor
 can you just tell me how it tastes when you put that in your pipe and smoke it
if i'm going to be verificationist i'd better figure out what it means to say that something is true i'm going to start with relativism
this one is all well it's true for me
guys come on this is the dumbest theory of truth this is the theory of truth that draws tattoos on itself in blue pen and then when you ask why anyone would draw a picture on their forearm of tree with sausages with the words sausage tree beneath it it gets mad and says you don't understand my truth
i'm i'm personifying a little here but that's seriously what relativism does
again ultra dumb
what i want is a theory of truth that's incontrovertible in fact i don't want even a theory of truth i want a fact of truth
oh yeah we'll see about that
well god i guess it really just goes to show you that there's many different competing ideas about what true really means
and that's the truth
wait i know some truths that are absolute mathematical truths how could i have been so blind
it is a fact that one plus one equals two
all i need is a way to convert mathematical truths to the real world and i will never be wrong again
but 1+2 is the same as 2+1
damn my potentially flawed senses
attention everyone i've ever met and ever will meet never mention the flawed senses idea again okay it prevents me from knowing absolute truth
patrick stewart what are you doing here
i have gone too far down the rabbit hole and am reduced to being sure only of my own thoughts and even then some other chump could be projecting them into my head to that i say whatever
people do fine with approximations
so what if truth is a platonic ideal that can't be reached i'm fine with that when someone says to me t rex your birthday is this saturday will i demand they prove it no i will say wicked sweettimes and then i would say what did you get me and then i would say i bet it's so awesome and that will be that
see it's true
or it's close enough to true that we all agree on it brains in jars don't get birthdays this is the reality i'm living in and if it's not real then oh well at least we'll all be eating ice cream cake come saturday you know
thanks don't you think it tastes like philosophical compromise
but you can hardly taste it eh
what if what if i had the best house ever this hallowe'en
guys i totally know
i must make this dream come true but how
not bad and i could have a spooky tape but instead of chainsaws and screams i'd have the voice of a man quietly dictating memories of his youth knowing alzheimer's will rob him of them soon
sure they will
man you just wait kids will be boarding the train to scarytowne at my house
because he's got a disease that robs him of his memories relationships and identity it is death before death
oooh what scary costumes
ah the start of a brand new year there's so much potential what could possibly go wrong
stood up on valentine's day
stood up on st patrick's day
thanks dromiceiomimus but man who stands someone up on st patrick's day besides my date that is
i can't believe i was stood up again today on cinco de mayo
remember my st patrick's day date the woman who stood me up
today is labour day labor day in the united states and she stood me up again
you know besides being stood up all the time it wasn't actually that bad a year
you know how in stories whenever a character has the chance he always decides that it's too dangerous to know too much about his own future
um i would like to know too much please
knowing who i marry knowing where i end up living all of these would be great timesavers
okay knowing just one thing then going through life knowing that no matter what i'm going to win the lottery for example
also good
i just want one little tidbit you know
man i coulda told you that i accidentally almost ate a whole pig at breakfast you know
oh my goodness
my future it's it's so awesome
sometimes someone will break up with you aw snaps what do you say to that
here are some things you can say to that
 it's okay sweetie i'm sure one day you'll find someone almost as good as me
 would you also break up with a rocket skateboard because those would be great like me i am great
 what if your next boyfriend is uglier
 honestly though i will always treasure the time we had together i liked who i was with you who we were together and i hope we'll both be able to take that with us in the future you've changed me and you're a part of who i am i know our relationship will be different now but i can't imagine ever not loving you
 oh were we dating
wouldn't it be funny if i planted a fake grave for future generations to discover
why yes it would
what i'm going to do is get a construction crew to put a skeleton wearing workman's clothes right in my house's walls then when my house is torn down in the future the deconstruction crew will wonder which of their unlucky cousins faced such a grim demise
from the internet
forget you internet your skeletons cost like $6000
well no a real one but if i use a fake one the prank will be found out too soon
seriously
i get to spend the rest of my life being in on a great joke and knowing that after i'm dead some honest tradespeople are going to be spooked then intrigued then cheezed off at me
not bad
god guess what i'm going to do today
indeed
fake graves for everyone
one of them will be a dude with the remains of a time machine and i'm gonna put him down at the permian triassic boundary the greatest extinction event ever in which 95% of all marine species and 70% of all land life became extinct i'm gonna make it look like this guy's time machine was responsible it'll be all there in his notebook my time machine accidentally blew up and is responsible for the mass extinctions frig
all of this will go in dromiceiomimus's back yark which i forgot to ask permission about
utahraptor in your back yard i'd like to bury a skeleton but i'm also gonna give him some extra fingers and also we'll cover him in feathers people will say who was this incredible feathered bird man with all the crazy fingers was he was he a god
tell me honestly mr tusks do you think my grave pranks are definitely the most awesome ideas you've ever heard
mr tusks are you just saying that for the pun
cargo cults are religions that have developed during world war ii in island tribal societies exposed to the west islanders saw planes delivering amazing and valuable cargo to the troops and believed it to be divine
during the war the islanders would see this cargo going to the troops and would grow to believe that the gods meant it for them that the white people were just getting it sooner because of their influential rituals and of couse after the war ended and the troops left the cargo stopped being dropped too
the islanders started mimicking what they'd seen the troops doing
the result was ersatz marches imitation airstrips and walkie talkies made out of wood and bamboo and even torch signal flares used to signal divine planes that never come
 i know it's crazy not in the pejorative sense but in the more esoteric holy crap the prime directive on star trek was right sense of crazy it's a very particular sense of crazy but i'm feeling it right now
what if what if i started my own cargo cult
aw man you say that for all the awesome stuff
what if i put chocolate sauce in my iced tea
i'm gonna
what if i started my own waterslide but put a fine layer of gasoline on top and then lit it so that when you slide you could slide through fire extreme but then if it got too hot you'd just have to go underwater to cool down
i'd give you a free pass
what if i made carbonated carbon
dromiceiomimus which kind of street does a ghost love best
a dead end
i know should you laugh or run in terror
hey utahraptor why don't bats live alone
because they prefer to hang out with their friends
booberry
mali boo
because they're aboolitionists
homophones are words that sound the same but mean different things like news and gnus way to go only part way homophones
don't bother showing up to my dinner party homophones
more impressive and still invited for yukon potato gnocchi are words that are spelt the same but have two different meanings words like attribute to credit something to someone and attribute a property of something one's a noun and one's a verb and it's seriously so awesome i cannot imagine how to perfect these words as they are already perfect oh ho ho
utahraptor let's be serious
are you not familiar with accent or with addict combine conduct conflict content and object perhaps you'd also like to say hello to perfect present progress refund suspect and upset
okay well they're at my dinner party tonight
man i've got to start inviting real people to my parties
i have not
sorry other word classes i have a new girlfriend now
a homographic homophonic autantonym is a word that is spelt and pronounced the same but has two opposite and contradictory meanings for example i can dust a crop adding pesticides to it or i can dust a counter removing dust from it way to go dust you are a winner you are a word that contains multitudes
probably because we want it to be incredibly awesome
indeed
all you can do is hope to use your real world knowledge about crops and tables to figure out what's going on and it's even worse with words like overlook meaning examine but also meaning miss noticing entirely can't rely on the noun there
what is not to like they're words that do their job in the most sarcastic sullen passive aggressive way possible and they totally get away with it
i just want to pat them on the head and ruffle their hair you know
he's just not that into you come on i can write a better self help book for people who want cold hard yet charmingly sassy relationship advice
probably
what
dromiceiomimus utahraptor put me on his friggin' book it's got me on the cover and it makes me look like i wrote it even though the title is just pure sass it is pure sassy molassy
i will right after i stomp on a few things to work off my anger that is
utahraptor
the mere sight of you has returned my anger why did you put out that book
someone put out sass ass book and said it was by utahraptor
all i've got to show for the past week is a bunch of books that nobody is ever going to read
not bad i wish i could have tried it
what when did you get that
man i missed out on rocket skating because i was writing books that sucks that
that sucks
well at least that sounds totally awesome to the max
so this homeless guy asked me for change yesterday
the first thing i thought was sure
but then i thought well wait if i really want to fight homelessness wouldn't this money be better spent on community programs that fight it both through helping the homeless and through political change but then i thought well this guy's right here you know and saying that i'm going to make a donation isn't gonna cut it and then i thought wait this guy looks pretty out of it is he going to spend my money on drugs do i want to tacitly support his addiction
sure did
and then i thought even if he is going to spend it on drugs is it my job to deny him money should i go around enforcing my morality on others and then i thought geez man how ridiculous am i that a guy asking for change throws me into these throes of self doubt and analysis
pretty ridiculous but then i recalled socrates the unexamined life is not worth living and at that point my head pretty much exploded
i gave him my change and whispered don't tell anyone until i can figure us out
my bike broke because i had maintained it poorly but you know what they say
 200 kilotons of prevention is worth 3200 kilotons of cure
they also say an apple a day keeps the doctor in his house look the doctor has no clients
it's so true
now that you mention it i have
you'd expect that over time they'd condense down to their core meanings but i guess that's our friggin' universe for you
 if there was a singular dickens who had to pee i would be so like him right now
who was the dude sitting alone at the biggest table in a packed restaurant last night waiting for friends who never came it was me
friiiiiig
i know i got the dates confused and there i was mr no friends who likes to pretend after about 30 minutes i started smiling at people who'd look at me and make this shrugging friends huh they sure are unreliable gesture which i'd then follow up with a i have lots of friends hand signal looks like this
i was but then i started trying to own it you know
i ordered this big appetizer platter for my friends when they arrive and distributed it so there was food for everyone slowly picking at my share while the rest went cold it was great i perfected this heart breakingly hopeful glance up whenever new people came it
eventually i just stopped looking up at all blankly staring at the chicken wing bones on my plate finally i ordered a piece of cake with a candle and sang happy birthday to myself quiet and soft
the waitress gave me the cake for free
i have the greatest idea for a movie i've said this before but this time it's for serious there's this cop right
right
and he's a by the books cop who does everything by the books but one day a big crime is committed and the only guy who knows anything about it is this criminal a criminal who is prone to cracking wise so the cop and the criminal have to team up to stop the bad guys before they commit crimes again and at the end they have learned to respect each other's way of life and they hug for a while five stars
um to solve crimes
 the movie takes place on a planet where interrogation is banned
so columbus discovers america right or at least he rediscovers the continent he discovers it for europe maybe not for the first time
columbus popularizes the continent
and afterwards what happens is what cooks call the columbian explosion where fruits and vegetables brought back from the new world have a profound effect on the cooking in the old one tomatoes and potatoes are but two of the best rhyming examples when people back home discovered these vegetables they started experimenting with them and coming up with all sorts of crazy yet delicious dishes the columbian explosion was an explosion of taste
exactly
and we don't think irish cooking without potato and south korean food is big on western peppers too it must have been an exciting time trying these new meals that nobody on the continent had ever tasted
it makes me wish we could have something like that you know i'm tired of the same old vegetables
and i'm tired of god offering to create new vegetables for me
okay maybe there were some downsides to the columbian explosion the old world got tomatoes and potatoes and corn and peanuts and rubber and cocoa and in exchange gave the new world lettuce
and also horses
and also the cholera and influenza and bubonic plague and typhoid fever and um smallpox so basically the world got this explosion of new and tasty times but also this exchange of disease and just about every culture on earth was affected but what's neat is that we can look forward to the same thing if we ever encounter alien life
well maybe
but we don t know anything about alien life maybe they'll look just like us and share diseases with us but with pointier ears and logic
maybe
maybe i should get me some clothes
 we need leaders who actually understand technology ahem amelia and antonio tony stood in the bedroom they were going to have sex this is how things looked like they were going to me the omniscient third person narrator sexy times ahoy
'we need leaders who actually understand technology ' muttered amelia
antonio tony nodded curtly taking off his pants it was so obvious amelia locked eyes with antonio paused and took off her shirt antonio smiled appreciatively 'there are so many bad laws passed through a misunderstanding of how computers actually work ' he thought amelia's breasts were pretty great antonio was hot too but this omniscient third person narrator is into the ladies
this one's new it's politically charged
 soon antonio and amelia had sex and it was great they decided they had a pretty good time suddenly you find yourself agreeing we need leaders who actually understand technology
in parts isn't it great
the book's slogan is think like me while you're imagining sex
sweet
aw boo
it sucks dromiceiomimus people stop me in the street and say i love your work and what do you say to that i'm glad you found my stories arousing because that's that's what i say
i say i'm glad you found my stories arousing and i shake their hand and i smile and stare at them for a long unblinking moment
yeah but a sex celebrity it stinks
so maybe they don't like it for the sex
lah lah lah lah lah i can't hear you lah lah lah what does god need with erotica anyway lah lah lah lah don't answer that lah lah lah
i would like to get thoughtful christmas presents for all my friends and family but i have a problem
i am just not that thoughtful a person
whoops
hey utahraptor if your house was on fire what one possession would you want to save
no i meant like what replaceable consumer electronics possession would you want to save also you can't already have the possession
is in an mp3 player look they have mp3 players here
aren't you always saying how you wish you could play your mp3s
i have never been more frustrated than i am right now i'm so frustrated i'm i'm gonna write a swear on a wall
there it says poo
i'm frustrated again
i'm frustrated at my apparent inability to have a serious conversation about feelings without making jokes about how ridiculous all feelings are ever
not that frustrated though i wrote poo on a wall
if someone says something is a whale of a good time i'm expecting to see some marine life
guys i am not alone in this
the phrase has been ruined bye people making the obvious stupid joke now it's only used by zoos featuring whales or by dads when then are taking their kids to visit zoos featuring whales it's also used by marine biologists and dads when they are taking their kids to visit marine biologists it's not even a good joke you are using the word whale when talking about a whale that's not comedy that's a literal use of adjectives
not always
it should mean a good time that is large or immense metaphorically like a whale but the metaphor's broken because it's always used on literal friggin' whales dog gone great is getting there too but im gonna fight it one person at a time
you are having an elephant of a good time
has there ever been a situation in which a tiger has eaten a penguin
and then the penguin is all dang
right so that leaves us the dinosaurs to introduce the two species and watch one of them get gobbled have we done that or have we been shirking our decadent tops of the food chain responsibility of unnatural carnivore pairings
probably because it's really interesting
i just figure it's a pretty short list of animals that haven't been eaten by a tiger you know and i don't know how many people have had the pleasure of seeing something eat something that that something has never eaten before but i'd like to be one of those people
whoever he is i bet he's handsome
what would be the best thing for me to do tonight as i see it i could do the dishes or i could mop the floors or i guess that i could invent an elixir that gives me the strength of twenty men
or i guess i could do all three
and that's the amazing true story of how i invented my elixir dromiceiomimus
almost it actually gives me the strength of twenty girlfriends
they're tough girlfriends
strength 20 girlfriends
no what i don't know how to explain it better if twenty girlfriends can lift up a car then i can lift up that car too
nope he's still asleep
sure thing
he talks like a 1920s villain
yeah but chap you know what i don't say
i don't say he slumbers still alack one thousand curses when the sandman's spell at last lies vanquished at his feet give him good heed doug has come calling
i know right
oh man i've just had an elephant of a good idea
touch o vision
smell o vision has been tried and vision and hearing are taken care of but two senses remain yet untapped taste o vision sounds disgusting but there's so much potential for touch o vision
like it's a boxing movie and whenever the underdog hero gets punched you get punched you'd start to think man i hope that guy wins then i'd get punched less
i admit only that there are issues
ooh what if what if here's a what if for you what if i make a million dollars
ow what the hell punchbot
i know it's terrible and i know many people are like this but i can't deny it any longer i am that guy
i am that guy who goes to stand up comedy and thinks man i could totally do that
and i know the best comics just make it look easy and i know it's hard to get a room full of strangers to laugh but nevertheless i am utterly convinced that i could do it
you know what i will
yep
exactly and if we get some friends in the audience at least they can laugh
you know what would be the worst meeting someone who was actually named al coholic
and he actually is an alcoholic
and he hasn't changed his name and he hates it and he drinks all the time and everyone laughs when they hear his name and then they get to know him and discover his illness and they feel awful they begin to wonder if their laughter makes him drink
maybe he's searching for an answer to that question dromiceiomimus at the bottom of a bottle
i'm just saying it would be the worst
if you were his friend you'd always say come on al stop drinking change your name at least go by your middle name and then he'd take a swig from the bottle wipe his mouth with the back of his hand and tell you his middle name is choc
he probably would man
poor al
i've never felt worse for inventing someone
i am a guy who likes to keep his hopes and dreams secret this is because if i fail to achieve them then only i know that i screwed up
works for me
it's like say i tell everyone i want to be an astronaut right and now it's 20 years later and i'm not an astronaut and it's some stupid what have you done with your life reunion and everyone's like hey t rex how's the astronaut lifestyle is it is it pretty achieveable
i'd much rather they say what did t rex say he wanted to be i can't recall i bet it's what he is now though
perhaps
but not everyone wanted to say be in a committed relationship and own a house before they were 25
see see this is why i keep my hopes and dreams to myself
hypothesis all movie titles can be made better by the addition of the word friggin'
proff by selected examples
back to the friggin' future
bill and ted's excellent friggin' adventure the ten friggin' commandments honey i shrunk the friggin' kids
some like it friggin' hot
denied
there is nuance subtlety in the placement of the friggin' contrast and compare the friggin' sound of music guess who's coming to friggin' dinner big friggin' trouble in little friggin' china and yes virginia there is a friggin' santa claus
right on
yes
 you're doing it wrong
i have recently acquired some snake oil and it has inspired me to compile a list of professions that have been ruined by lexicalized phrases
first snake oil salesmen
since the phrase now means con artist nobody wants to be a snake oil salesman but i presume there was a point when a man could procure some snake oil and go door to door selling it and maybe those guys wrecked it for the rest of us maybe they were all chumps maybe they were all in fact superchumps
i knew it
panacea that's the secret word of the day
oh my god i just realized that yesterday when utahraptor said universal panacea he was using a pleonasm
 pleonasm is the use of redundant unnecessary words to express an idea
hah hah this is utahraptor hey t rex do you want to drink some cola flavoured coca cola brand carbonated cola beverages perhaps afterwards we'll take the public transport large road vehicle bus and buy with money or credit some submarine sub sandwiches
that's totally him domiceiomimus
sorry could your vocal chords and mouth repeat that
maybe after the subs sandwiches we could go to a water lake beach shore
we could go to the water lake beach shore in our water lake beach shore swimming shorts for swimming in water
but it's winter
science dudes
i have some bad news
i think that time travel might not actually be possible
because say i travel to the future and take back some sweet future technology let us say hoverbikes nice and then people in the present can examine the hoverbikes and see how they work to duplicate them which is also nice until we get to the future and the guy who invented hoverbikes won't do it anymore because they've already been invented he doesn't want to be a copycat assume for the sake of argument that he doesn't want to be a copycat
yes
the creativity that was required to create hoverbikes has been erased who had the insight now
but they're inventions without an inventor and you can do the same thing with works of art
science dudes are you even listening to me
dear body here are some things you need to stop doing
aging
also making weird noises
dromiceiomimus yesterday i'm sitting there and my belly kind of goes tweeeeet like it's a a a bird or something what's with you belly i know you're there yes i don't need a tweeeeet to say hello i just put food in you and that is gonna have to be introduction enough
as a matter of fact i do
one my body needs to survive in space two it needs to be able to eat paper in an emergency three flight would be nice also four sometimes when i'm sleeping i get a cramp in my leg muscles and i have to punch the muscles
four is the worst also five i wish my body would poop more instead of putting on weight
no seriously because
because i don't like being fat and pooping is good times
there are many situations in which that's what she said may be appropriately used for example after someone says uh
 what a good date
that's what she said
well you can use that's what she said when telling a story too
yeah like anneke said 'how do you do ' to clarify that's what she said
that's what she said
finally normally this isn't so hard
utahraptor don't interrupt i was saying normally it doesn't take me this long to finish with something good even if it's just a little ejaculation
climate change huh
there certainly is a lot of climate that's changing right right can i get a witness
or maybe climate isn't changing at all or maybe it is but who cares because it's all someone else's fault
or maybe the climate is supposed to change because we all got new swimmin' trunks
serious concern i just stepped on a tiny woman so her only influence on the climate is that now she's dead
in the climate
right now she's probably saying oh man what a change for me a climate change that is
hey remember when there were frogs
no problem i have the whole weekend to find christmas presents i'll get great gifts no matter
 what what where the heck did saturday do what
 the heck sunday is gone too
okay i have today to find presents i'm safe just as long as i don't end up somehow skipping a day ahead in the narrative of my life and missing out on the whole entire
 day to repeat utahraptor i did zero shopping yesterday
i know thank
i'm glad you like it what uh what was it i got you again
 mix of layla and smells like teen spirit into one song so everyone can listen to both of my favourite songs at the same time
this is what i keep saying
i love punch i love drinking delicious punch probably because of how it's so delicious
hooray for punch
quite likely i don't know why i'm suddenly so into what is essentially juice mixed with maybe pop or alcohol served in a fancy bowl with spoons but i'm running with it
oh god yes
man this party even has a stomping room i'm totally going to get some punch soon
dude i'm gonna i'm gonna go get in line for some punch right now
is this the punch line
so you're saying there is no punch line
what did the depressed snowman say to his dog
 snowbody loves me
he said it to his dog because snowbody loved him he had snow friends
snow it's not
it is so funny listen i told these jokes to a snowman and he laughed
a lot of my friends are having babies
that's what i say to them they say t rex marcia and i are expecting a little bundle of joy and i say ted i respect you and love you as a friend but i have to ask what's the deal what is the deal with the babies
that's just part of the deal
as a man who is without babies the idea of being in charge of another person's life seems insane that's a lot of responsibility and i have no idea if i'm qualified for that or if anyone else is for that matter so i have to ask
with the babies yes
men we like stories right
but they have to be good stories stories with plots in which there are good guys and bad guys and then some explosions happen to them
in a good story they function as punctuation marks hamlet says to be or not to be and the building behind him blows up it is spectacular the audience whispers yes this is what shakespeare meant
you say it like it's not fantastic
sometimes they go off in the background and they barely glance over their shoulder at them sometimes they outrun them down halls or by climbing up ladders real fast it depends on the scene you know
hamlet sips some whiskey while punching a man in the nose ophelia says she's crazy for him and they go on a helicopter ride a ghost appears and when hamlet high fives him he explodes then denmark explodes
later ophelia's topless
my stories for men were a huge success but i've excluded half of my potential market
i've got a great idea dromiceiomimus stories for women stories with feelings stories where someone sighs deeply while looking at a photograph of someone else in the photograph that someone else is also sighing deeply
ha ha of course not this was just a hilarious test um
sure
no problem
two attractive people meet and fall in love then they take baths and hug
it's what women want
man if this were a bath and there was a woman here and i was hugging her
i'd be totally set
this one's easy
that's because kids are easily entertained they just want bright colors that flash and spin i can take care of that with a kaleidoscope a story about a kaleidoscope i mean
no no i want twelve year olds too so ah the kaleidoscope can transform into a ninja turtle who can mutate into a robot or a barbie or a horse
or horse barbie done
yes
if by story you mean franchise anyway i don't know i think i've lost focus
excuse me child your early stages of puberty they they
oh the things i could do if i had a rubber mallet
but wait this is one idle daydream that i can make come true dromiceiomimus how much does a rubber mallet cost
dromiceiomimus
i have a few dollars
quick to the hardware store
no you're coming because this is a mallet party the only tool we're going to have is rubber mallets which function as hammers and then all of our problems are going to look like nails oh yes
this is going to be so great
they were out of rubber mallets so i bought a vegetable steamer instead now all my problems look like vegetables in need of a good steaming
i've
i've made worse purchases
there was a man freestyle rapping outside my window last night
it was pretty okay his rhymes were moderately tight too
about 4am i woke up to it which was surreal it ended when i guess someone dissed him from across the street or behind some bushes or something heyelled who said that and ran off down the street
no man
it was like he was walking down the street rapping to himself and just happened to stop outside my place when his flow got going i can respect that i kinda want to be that guy you know
all sorts of topics really
 what
i'm not
i'm not i don't
 kiss whom
i don't know
you don't hear that
apparently not
i was gonna do that anyway
whatever
i have invented the best way to reveal the prejudices and preconceptions of my friends
reverse lightbulb jokes
dromiceiomimus i'll give you the punchline and you'll supply the identifiable social group to be mocked okay the puchline is just one they hold the lightbulb still while the world revolves around them
interesting
sure
um okay just one but it doesn't matter they'll never see the light anyway
oh snap wow classy guys
alright last one everyone both of them
pardon
pick up eggs
sure do
sure do
oh i uh i sure do like that colour on you utahraptor
it uh
it goes well with your eyes
man what's the deal with nobody hearing you but me god it's a hassle
i have the best joke for dromiceiomimus
is it my curse to always have the best jokes
okay dromiceiomimus here is the best joke ever for you it's way better than all other jokes
so i went to the chiropractor right and he examined me and said what happened to your back and i smiled at him and i said well doc let me tell you the backstory
man she's right it was terrible
what
don't even joke about that utahraptor i rely on my sense of humour as a social lubricant it's the secret to how come girls want to kiss me sometimes
mr tusks what if i'm clean out of funny jokes
noooooooo
guys guys
our universe is almost certainly a simulation
i know right
because check it out if you assume that computers will continue to get better then it stands to reason that one day we'll be able to simulate an entire universe and then there'll be a day shortly afterwards when we can simulate universe on our cell phones and once you imagine this possibility what are the odds that our universe is the one real one it's much more likely that all creation is running in the background of some future dude's iphone 3k
i am yes
that's stupid
noooooooooo
ghost have got to be the saddest thing ever they're dead people plus they're blind
that's right i said it ghosts are blind
they have to be because they're invisible and light needs to hit something to be seen and if ghosts have transparent eyes they're not going to see anything plus you can walk right through a ghost so sound waves will pass through them too they're deaf and blind most of the time and when they do become a little visible the world that fades into focus around them is filled with people screaming at them in terror it's so sad
yep
ghosts have to be invisible at least part of the time that's what makes them ghosts but if you accept that it's fun to try to see how ghostlike you can make them without making any further assumptions
the curses of the greek gods
not actually that bad
for example prometheus
guy gives fire back to mortals and as punishment by zeus he's chained to a rock and has his liver eaten by a vulture every day
but his liver magically regenerates overnight
so prometheus' liver is a perfectly clean natural and renewable fuel source
he doles out to the world a small amount of an infinite supply of biofeul daily
way to go prometheus
still it's not that bad
screw everyone else
she can avoid falling pianos and win the lottery
boo hoo
and before you say sisyphus he's immortal plus he's got time to ponder the universe plus a buff bod
all i'm saying is it wouldn't be terrible
it's not that bad
oh wow is that a quarter on the ground
oh it's one someone glued to the ground as a joke
hah hah
there's a boxing kangaroo at the circus
there's a boxing kangaroo at the circus
it's so great dromiceiomimus it's a real boxing kangaroo with big red boxing gloves like in the zeitgeist and in cartoons and he boxes a person so hard that they get their hat knocked off and then when they go to pick up their hat he boxes them in the butt
we have to go
you sure did dromiceiomimus and i are going you should come you should come because the kangaroo is going to solve his problems with his fists and when he's done his problems are gonna be solved right in the face
hah hah what's the matter monocle guy you don't like being boxed by a kangaroo
hah monocle guy the kangaroo just punched off your monocle
natural gas in its natural state is colorless and odourless right but when it's sold we add a distinctively smelly chemical to it so that gas leaks can easily be detected
this provides an opportunity for ample pranks of hilarity
all i have to do is find out what that odorant is get some myself and spread it around someplace people will think that there's a gas leak when really all there will be is um
tertiary butyl mercaptan
see i thought it was too but then i thought maybe it's not
daaaamn that is a much more hilarious joke
guys that's me
 i did that
it was great dromiceiomimus a whole town that had been abandoned all these collapsing buildings and rusting machines it was apocalypse porn
we should go it's so great you get a glimpse of what the world would be like if it all went wrong and we all died tomorrow
the mine dried up and everyone moved away
but the buildings are still there and they're great it's clich but walking around you see all these amazing little tokens of previous life a forgotten doll a can of food long since unidentifiable dromiceiomimus and i are going back want to come
don't even utahraptor
don't even don't even tell me you don't appreciate the stark aesthetics and beauty of decay
i have lots of my own money so i can eat cookie dough whenever i want i don't even have to cook it
i don't
/ t rex my job is astronaut
yeah
hey remember when my mom switched off my computer for no reason and didn't even let me save my game i bet she feels bad about it now and wishes she had been nicer to me now that i've moved out forever just like i said i would
oh excellent
that's that's just excellent
ssh come closer
i know more secrets
more secrets of the medical profession
okay so peritonitis is when your peritoneum gets infected and the peritoneum is basically the lining for your abdominal cavity where your guts are so if that's infected you're going to be in pain whenever your belly moves and when the doctor walks in the room he might see how you're sitting cautious in your movements guarding your belly and he might suspect peritonitis and then he might accidentally bump into your bed or chair
if you start to scream from just that small bump he'll know the peritonitis is bad
well they can just come up and say i'm going to shake your belly so tell me if it hurts but that primes the patient and they'll be looking to feel pain the bump can get you an unsolicited result and lets you quickly ascertain degree
yep and then they'll send you for emergency surgery did you know that one of peritonitis' causes is your bowels becoming perforated so that raw sewage sloshes around in your belly
man bodies are nasty i can totally see why nascent machine intelligences don't wanna hang with us
my last attempt to be a motivational speaker didn't go so well but this time i have a plan generative advice for example
 customers know what they want but they want what they know
i know right but i totally just made it up according to my generative advice formula and i have tons more like for a restaurant customers eat what they see but they see what they eat
maybe because it follows the first one
okay yeah it's obvious but it works and it can be customized to any environment self help do what you want but want what you do writers write what you know but know what you write
 colonize what you explore but explore what you colonize
 tame what you keep but please keep what you tame
 nurses take care of the injured but they injure who they take care of
okay whatever my formula is still good despite nurse racism
okay so it's wwii and we're in casablanca and people here want to go to america but they can't but check it out
i'm an american named rick and i have two free tickets to america
fine
i know
you appear to help the nazis in the film but then you let me get away with murdering one at the end so that ilsa and her weaksauce husband can go to america the movie should really be about our relationship
too late we already did
see why didn't i ever say that to you
this movie needs way more gay
i've never worked retail how bad could it be
this job is killing me and i can feel it
it's terrible dromiceiomimus every customer is either rude or bland and my coworkers are all spiritually beaten down and when i look at them i know that soon i will be spiritually broken too and the worst part the worst part is that weekends suck because i know work starts up again on monday i hate mondays now
i have become garfield
utahraptor
it totally is
and it's boring too it's so boring it literally steals my life force i'm not even misusing literally there i have a life force and it's precious and then i go in and then when i come out i have less of it hot crackers you know what i do to pass the time
i stare at the mannequins
building a time machine is hard
but maybe building a time machine to an alternate universe not so hard
see dromiceiomimus my new plan is to visit alternate universes to take back objects and ideas from them hopefully that will be much easier than using godless science to violate the natural laws of time
a little but a lot of alternate universes would probably be at about the same tech level what i'm really interested in is culture
exactly
that's a great example shakespeare wrote some fantastic plays but there's only so many of them but infinite parallel shakespeares on infinite parallel typewriters pretty much have to give us some terrific pieces of literature
shakespeare is the greatest author in history but all he's written is 38 plays and 154 sonnets about how much likes to gaze at yonder bosoms
sometimes i feel the only purpose of our universe is to act as a warning for others
so i've got this computer problem and i can't figure it out half the time it boots up it find the sound card but half the time it doesn't aren't computers deterministic
i really thought computers were deterministic
but now it seems instead of a computer i've got this magic feelings box on my desk and when my feelings box feels like i deserve music i get it and when it doesn't i don't it's voodoo dromiceiomimus it is voodoo
he said it after he invented satellites i know
well utahraptor as you know any sufficiently advanced music player will be indistinguishable from magic
wait you've given me a great idea has that saying ever been applied to parties
thanks ladies
okay
oh god utahraptor do you think the nes was the greatest video games system ever
the devil is clearly trying to get me involved in a doubtlessly fruitless discussion of omg best video game system evar and i was hoping maybe you could take the ball on this one
oh god it already is
okay look you want to know what the greatest video game system ever is it's the n gage
the problem with valentine's day is that if you get your sweetie chocolates the sweetness of the gesture is tainted with some measure of societal expectation
that's the problem with valentine's day
and that's all i have to say on the subject
what
these chocolates don't taste like they're tainted by societal expectation at all thank you utahraptor
they taste a little like ironic comeuppance but
i like that flavour
synesthesia is an amazing neurological condition in which one sensory pathway involuntarily stimulates another the result is sensory overlap tones with distinct tastes letters of the alphabet with their own shades of colour
people with synesthesia basically have super powers
there's all sorts of synesthesia some people taste words and syllables when they say them sometimes even if they just think them others have distinct personalities associated with numbers or letters so that the letter m might be polite while 7 gets all up in everyone's fries they still sense normally it's just they've got this extra layer of perception on top of what the rest of us get i admit to being jealous
oh wow really
i'd love to meet her i know she might not be as into her condition as i am and that i'm probably glorifying it or at least fetishizing it some but i'd still love to talk to her about it
i see what you're saying there
pretty clever right my friends say i'm pretty clever
we should date
so i kind of shot my mouth off on an online forum
and it happened to be a forum in which i use my real name
and now i am concerned that if someone looks up my name online they will see me acting like a jerk and will conclude that i am a jerk and then they won't want to hire me or marry me or whatever they they won't want to do the thing that they were thinking of doing before they looked up my name
avoid it dude
the way i figure it after about five years we gain the ability to look back on anything and laugh and i can reasonably say oh but i was young and stupid back then so basically i'm going to wait five years and then stop worrying about it
i know grandma
how didthe muffins you were planning to bake turn out
good nobody's around now i can do something really embarrassing
it occurs to me every time i do something private i'm really just betting that technology to look into the arbitrary past won't ever be developed because if it is ever invented game over man game over people will be able to look at any moment in history
folks will know all of my embarrassing little secrets
okay yeah i read them all i'm saying is it just takes this tech to be developed once at any point in the future and my privacy is pooched friggin' dudes watching me poop 20 000 years in the future
some people do not cherish awkward moments as i do lukily for them i have come up with a solution
the solution as in most things is smooching
awkward moments are awkward because nobody knows what to do or say but if you swoop in for a kiss it's no longer an awkward moment you've avoided it entirely by transitioning it into a moment of oh great what the hack now i have to slap this person for their unwanted advances or even a moment of oh great what the heck now they love me too
	what
seriously can you teach me
with words
nobody even noticed how i made my examples of the awkward moment kiss gender neutral
it's so you can imagine a man slapping a woman after an unwanted kiss and then you get to examine your ideas of gender roles and heteronormativity
i would like to have an inclined treadmill so that i could build an indoor skateboarding track am i that crazy
am i that crazy to dream
the idea is that it's like a moving sidewalk but the speed is computer controlled so you hop on your skateboard and get on the track and within a few moments the speed of the treadmill is exactly matching the speed your board would otherwise be travelling at you're not moving but the board feels like it's travelling at speed
the slogan will be yes you can skateboard in your apartment in winter
sure
but can you imagine how fun it would be to have that sensation of movement indoors while not actually moving
here's a solution to that don't fall down
oh yeah nobody is gonna want to buy the terminal velocity skateboard simulator
extreme
okay so whatever maybe the terminal velocity skateboard simulator would never reach terminal velocity since there's no wind resistance but do we not have an obligation to future generations to make sure
whatever if i were in the future and i could open up a book and see the awesome terminal velocity skateboard didn't work oh well then i would do that
ridiculous there's friction in the wheels that
fine you know what fine i'm done dreaming
okay now i'm done dreaming
guys guys
i came up with a way to get my skateboard treadmill to work
all i need is a treadmill that tilts
that way rather than relying on friction and stuff to manage the position of the skateboarder i can just tilt the incline up or down in order to keep them in the right position then hey presto it works and physics is happy for once
alternatively i could have a giant fan like the kind used in skydiving simulators and use air to help keep the skateboarder where i want him to be
it's true
and i realized if i do have this giant fan it'll be way more fun to use it offensively than it'd be to simulate skating indoors so anyway i bought the fan installed it on my house and now i blow enemies off my lawn
utahraptor it's so awesome
attention enemies
why not come onto my lawn for a second
wouldn't it be great if people didn't need to be happy
yes yes it probably would
i mean i get that depression unhappiness has a host of issues associated with it but what i'm describing is more ahappiness the ability to not need happiness at all happiness is this this fuel that we need to function in society but it doesn't last forever and then we need to find more it's like food only it's drained every time we have to do something sucky also you can't buy happiness at a grocery store i'm sorry safeway but you just can't
but what if i removed that desire for happiness what if instead of feeding the world i simply killed hunger
 do this utahraptor do you seriously think i'd explain my masterstroke if there was the slightest chance of you affecting it's outcome
i did it thirty five minutes ago
hah just kidding i tried to come up with a way to suppress happiness but i'm not happy with the results yet
bah dum dum ching
it turns out my ahappiness idea is actually pretty close to the buddhist idea of transcending desire i have independently invented buddhism
nice
that's one for the ol' resume eh dromiceiomimus independently invented buddhism put that down next to received props from a bear high fived a bear and has a driver's license that suggests my middle name is 'commander punchy'
who could forget
my friend i sure do
it's my emergency resume used only in situations in which i really really want the job if it's a regular old job it gets the regular old resume but if it's a really good job i bust out the e r
hasn't failed me yet
but have you examined appendix a of my resume in whice there is an amazingly sweet holographic batman sicker
before i used to dread the what are you doing with your life question but not anymore this is because i've decided what i'm doing with my life creating shakespeare video games
could this truly be the greatest calling ever
and i already have tons of ideas like richard the third the game in the introductory thematic you trade your kingdom for a horse and then you spend the rest of the game riding around your old kingdom on a horse
with stealth elements your horse isn't very good and so sometimes you're embarrassed about your horse and then you have to sneak around
i know i do
no that's dumb the ice level is called oh no king richard the third has chilly pants
look i'm going to prototype it tonight so by this time tomorrow we'll see what's what
so utahraptor what do you think
it's as far as i got before it was too awesome
my richard the third the video game is going to be fantastic
all i need to do is program it
um apparently programming is for folks who are thrilled when a computer reminds them they're missing a bracket or semicolon it must be because they make that happen so often
i can't even get richard the third to move you know what my game is now my game is nibbles with the text changed from copyright microsoft 1990 to man forget this
i know that
i just thought it was a skill i could pick up easily i don't need to know everything i don't need to know the difference between friggin' binary and b+ search trees all i want to know is how to make richard iii's sucky horse do double jumps you know
hey here's a tip
crawling sucks
i have a problem i have come into possession of a pin from the 1935 nuremberg rally and i really don't know what to do with it hitler's face is on the pin it's a nazi pin i have a nazi pin
this is not good news for team t rex
i'm trapped i can't just throw it out because it's history but there's no way i'm selling it either i don't want to profit from um nazis and i wouldn't want to sell to anyone who'd be interested in buying it anyway
my grandfather died a few months ago and i was given this part of his estate he found it after the war in the rafters of a house he bought
man i don't want to go through life as a nazi pin guy
to whom hi you seem like a woman who appreciates her nazi memorabilia no i can't just pass this off on someone else it just shifts these issues onto them i've got to handle this myself
i'll think of something
what if i started wearing it under a shirt when i go out that way if i got hit by a car the discovery of the pin will entirely overshadow anything i've ever accomplished in my life
no that that only makes things worse
i have a new problem now i have come into possession of several kilograms of nazi memorabilia
it it came in the mail
somehow word got out that i'm a nazi pin guy and now i have everyone else's nazi pins and flags and uniforms and boots and chapeaus i basically have a wwii re enactment society in my basement dromiceiomimus but only for one side
i wish i knew why
that's a great idea
my pin was too common to interest a museum but the rest of this stuff could be given away like that
wow all i have to do is follow your advice and all my problems are solved
oh i'm sorry did i accidentally hire a plan criticizer i thought i was hiring a reverse pickpocket
ted's so great i just want to hang out with him all day long
it's like hanging out with a computer friend only he has emotions well i guess it's more like hanging out with a regular friend only when he says pass me a bowl of fruit it comes out as a monotonic pass me a boal of frui it what's not to like
what he has dromiceiomimus is a gift the gift is labelled best accent ever
i'm not
utahraptor his speaking voice sounds like a text to speech synthesizer that is awesome that is objectively awesome
mr tusks
this smile is because i'm always happy to see you not for your conversational betrayal
how come car bumpers aren't all at the same height on cars it's dumb that they're not the whole point of bumpers is to cushion bumps but if they don't meet then they only serve as impact hasteners
i could say this is one situation in which the free market fails but i won't
i can already see where that would go a discussion of how style sells cars and bumpers are subject to that but how government controls could legislate that all bumpers be a standard height thereby saving lives then we could segue into internationalization problems with how foreign car makers might not want to redesign their cars for only our market but we still need cars so hey let's talk corporate control over our national interests and so on
oh wow agreed
wow you taught it to recognize me
i have come up with the ultimate disaster movie it is called oh gosh a series of disasters and what happens is a guy gets out of bed stubs his toe and says
 oh gosh
then he falls down the stairs
then he smashes through a load bearing beam at the bottom and his house collapses and then a spark from a broken lamp ignites the gas and his house explodes shooting the guy out into the sky and lighting the surrounding houses on fire by the time the fire department arrives the entire block is aflame and also their fire truck is on fire then the fire reaches a power station causes a cascade failure and power goes down for the enitre country and soon the world
the guys in charge of preventing that were watching the fires on tv
anyway things progress and characters keep saying what is with this series of disasters it's so good utahraptor volcanoes erupt earthquakes strike and meteors hit just as soon as all the other stuff gets boring
yes but after the credits the original guy wakes up and says whew it was all a dream then he gets out of bed stubs his toe turns to the camera in terror wide eyed and screams oh gosssssh
holy crap there's nothing not to like in my movie
normally people have trouble with sequels after their first idea is so and i'll say it so transcendentally brilliant but not me i have ideas for basically infinite sequels
basically infinite out of genre cover sequels that is
when my explosion centric disaster movie comes out and people want more i will say to them no actually you want the same thing but this time as a gross out comedy
hah precisely and it keeps happening throughout the film the power goes out and nationwide folks slip on the lube
even better
some teens go out on a road trip and unwittingly stay just ahead of all the destruction you can see it in the background of some of the shots but they never notice because they are all too busy learning about friendship
a western a loner cowboy caught between wilderness and civilization enters the nation and tries to stop the disasters
no he shoots a lot of guys while failing to stop it though
 there is a showdown between a cowboy and a volcano
the amazing story of edward s curtis edward s curtis was a photographer of american indians in the early 1900s i know he was tough because his middle name was sheriff
for most of his life he documented the disappearing great race of the indian
he took over 40 thousand photographs not bad for one guy and in many cases his records are the only recorded history we've got but what's amazing about curtis is that he specifically set out to record the doomed people his culture imagined indians to be the noble savage the indian that was alien stoic exotic and dying
and when he met indians that didn't meet his expectations he just changed them for his photographs
man he carried boxes of indian clothing and wigs with him ethnic signifiers for his subjects if they didn't look indian enough and his indian was clean shaven so he'd pay men to shave
yep i think it's amazing how we've still got this idea of the indian that we look for if there's no headdress we're disappointed
that's what i'm saying
everybody's friggin' racist
gwen stefani is not a holla back girl this is her shit and it is recognized as bananas
bananas is spelt b a n a n a s
the narrator can't help himself and wants you and nobody else you are aware of this despite or because of this you sugarpie honeybunch left a picture of yourself in his possession and he kissed it one thousand times
marilyn monroe wants to be loved and kissed by you she has no greater aspirations and is filled with desire to make you her own
boop boop a doop
the beach boys well it seems the beach boys wish they were older living together and sleeping with each other
they describe such a scenario as nice
other scenarios they describe as nice include all five beach boys waking up together spending the day together and then holding each other close they also wish their kisses were neverending as that would be nice and they wish they were all married they'd be happy wouldn't be nice they ask each other in the chorus largely rhetorically
so heteronormative
listen if there's a group of people on stage and they start out throwing out wouldn't it be nice if we were older s i don't imagine a hypothetical female third party i look at them
that is an audience member baby acting as a scribe
after moving in together the beach boys take a trip to surf city where there's two women for every man
it's difficult to reconcile the events in this song with established beach boys canon
what what
okay um there was a young man who would yell that we all had a story to tell feelings in his bones said to find a home from the queen of england to the hounds of hell
i know right go me
it's fun
okay honestly who wants to hear about nazi pins
and instead who wants to hear me sing the classic rock power ballad total eclipse of the heart while simultaneously transforming the chorus into one focused on naughty limericks
um
you only get one vote utahraptor
you know the trope in cartoons where there's a help wanted sign and the unemployed hero will go into the store and take the sign down because he's so sure he'll get the job
but then the boss hates him so much that he literally kicks him out and then slaps the sign back up
i wish that happened more in real life
 sigh
so
yes you're right this is my chance i forgot about it untill now
oh man oh man
guess what mom i got a job i don't want as a florist today entirely by accident
mom
it's because i am trying to live in cartoons
a lot of people seem to have trouble separating actors from their roles
but not me
i'm different from everyone else i get that bruce willis might not be that useful if terrorists take over an office tower christmas party
nope he'd have to earn it we'd do sports or something to see
i really don't
i won't say that i'm better for having this skill of actor separation but it's a skill i have that makes me better
ben i question your acting ability if we were all friends i am certain you would be the irritating one
oh my gosh utahraptor i concede your point
okay so let's say i sleep 8 hours a day that's 16 hours a day i'm awake
and let's say i'm knocked unconscious for on average 2 hours a year
that takes into account times i hit my head on low hanging chandeliers and times when enemies punch my head okay so that's what 243 days of consciousness a year 66% of the year i've had almost 18 years of consciousness since i was born
i should have done more by now
exactly
cancer's a bad example because i'm so far from being a doctor but what have i done with my mind with my brainpower i've had effectively 18 full years uninterrupted without sleep to think about the world's problems and i've solved zero of them
man i still haven't solved any world issues this is like a mid life crisis except it's been ongoing since i was six
aw crap i'm not married yet either
hah i sure did describe ninja turtles as being neat splinter taught them to be ninja teams what's not neat about that
he gave them the tools they needed for life success
what no i never said that it's not true
i never said that dromiceiomimus you'd better not have quotation marks around that
i'm not this is an unreliable narrator
total sass
oh my god total sass
i'm not even 30 years old
maybe bums refers to our nation's homeless persons
i did and i stand by it
listen okay you don't have to be taught how to be a ninja teen if you're a ninja and you're a teen then you're already being a ninja teen but working in groups can be a challenge especially for siblings and splinter provided valuable leadership and guidance on that matter and that's what the lyrics are saying he taught them to be ninja teams
everyone is wrong but me
and i'll prove it to you i'll track down kevin eastman and peter laird and find out alright and then you'll all have to apologize to me and say oh t rex i was so wrong teamwork is the real treasure
i'm doing it
peter laird and kevin eastman
i must request that you give me a break
a lot of folks get tattoos commemorating life experiences they've had
guys we can do better
i'm going to get tattoos commemorating life experiences i wish i'd had perhaps a nice banner on my chest that says around the world race participant giraffe division or there could be a picture of me riding a giraffe and then the giraffe is straddling the world
that's why i'm working in the fanciful medium of the tattoo
i know
i also thought passive aggressive tattoos would be fun like instead of a heart that says mom a heart that says hey mom thanks for buying me a private island and then when my mom sees it and says i never bought you that i can say not yet and smile
what i want is a to do list on my hand only it says be awesome and that's crossed out and then get tattoo and that's crossed out and then sex up the person reading this
sir i promise nothing
an unreliable narrator is when shakespeare tells you that his play hamlet is pretty good but then at the end hamlet wakes up and he's on a friggin' bus
it's like oh it was all a dream and the whole time hamlet was actually snoozing on a bus next to an empty seat the whole time what the heck hamlet laertes was the bus driver this is so much worse than when you were stabbin' dudes and havin' broods
pretty certain it does dromiceiomimus
the stupid it was all a dream ending in hamlet
he wakes up and looks around and he catches teh eye of a passenger who looks like shakespeare and the shakespeare guy smiles and winks the end
don't tell me i'm the only one who made it to the end of hamlet
shakespeare hamlet actually ends on a bus right
it's a little thing called a metaphor will man study literary techniques much
i'd like to take the bus please
what are your first impressions of the area
please hand me the customs declaration form
i have only personal items i have nothing to declare
this is carry on baggage
may i cash this traveler's check
i buy my clothes off the rack
i buy my clothes off the rack
not enough things glow in the dark
that's right i said it
not enough things glow in the dark and the things that glow in the dark don't glow in the dark for long enough even if i had a glow in the dark skull it would only glow for like two minutes that is only two kinds of spooky spookily sucky and spookily disappointing
all i ever wanted is a plastic skull that lights up in the dark so that in the dark everyone can see my spooky plastic skull
alright fine so it's a battery problem
i don't need a laptop battery all i want is a spooky skull so that when criminals break into my house they see a grim visage of things to come
today is act like a t rex day everybody
act like me
dromiceiomimus act like me today okay it'll be great examine what i'm doing and then try internalizing it okay
what
act like a dromiceiomimus day i have not heard of this holiday
but but
 whispering i'm a dromiceiomimus pretending to be a t rex
i said
i'm a dromiceiomimus pretending to be a t rex
shakespeare was a famous writer guy but we know basically nothing about him there's only a handful of times when we know what he was doing on a given day
and at other times there's no record of him for years and years
the fact that we have any record of him as a person at all is only due to the fact that he appeared in court a few times as a witness and that he got married legal records are all we've got his interests and tastes politics and loves &#8212 they all have to be unreliably extrapolated from his writing
that's true i just wish we knew more about the man you know
so let's agree if one of us ever get a chance to go back in time and we run into him then we'll definitely ask shakespeare what he was up to what he likes what his interests are &#8212 all the stuff historians wish they had
shakespeare oh shakespeare do you know where my car keys are shakespeare
hey shakespeare
i don't think people actually used alack like that
hey hey god hey
look at me i'm talking like you
hey dromiceiomimus you'd better not have any sexy fun times because i'm god and i don't like that
i get jealous or something i don't know
hey utahraptor
utahraptor it is because we are pretending to be god

guys i just had a revelation about god for serious
god is all knowing and all seeing right so it follows through logic that that
that god has to be the biggest fanboy ever who knows more about every star trek episode than god who knows more about each and every comic anime and manga series ever conceived than god he's like this ultimate obsessive fanboy nerd
 gasp you're right
he has encyclopaedic knowledge about every rpg mmorpg fps rts tbs and if game every made
god are you the biggest nerd
second place in last month's sassy assy competition
today is a good day i think to reminisce about the past
okay here i go
dana was totally flirting with me
hah i can't believe i didn't see it at the time i can't believe i didn't see it until now
i went to university with her she said at the time that she found me handsome and i said that it was probably just her own ideas of attractiveness interacting with my own personality and unchangeable genetics
what the heck past me
i guess i was young and believed no woman could ever find me attractive of her own volition
but what a nice realization to finally have though right perhaps where were dozens of women flirting with me in the past yet unnoticed
what you suggest in jest i will do with conviction
today is a good day i think for talking about my love
 my love of george clooney that is
i love him i think he's great he was good in the medical comedy e/r the medical drama er and was not the worst batman from the original movie arc
hah i would say that i might have a touch of cloonacy
did you know that he was named a messenger of peace by the united nations utahraptor
yep and he was given the title of sexiest man alive by people magazine twice
i know right sometimes i worry i like george clooney too much but then i realize there's no such thing as too much love for george clooney
i have chloomydia
 now they show you how detergents take out bloodstains a pretty violent image there i think if you've got a t shirt with a bloodstain all over it
 maybe laundry isn't your biggest problem
i know i know but he's a funny guy right and i was thinking maybe if i told his jokes i could get inside his head and understand how he comes up with them act like seinfeld in order to become seinfeld you know
it's really not meant to be
incidentally utahraptor somebody just gave me a shower radio do i really want music in the shower i guess there's no better place to dance than a slick surface next to a glass door
come on it's the exact same joke
wait no newman
 newman
yes there it is
i don't live near trees
that's astronomically unlikely
man my enemies suck
frig i think i missed my bus
before we had dictionaries words could be spelt in a variety of different ways now that we have dictionaries spellings are fixed
this i accept
it speeds up reading and comprehension and spelling errors give editors easy points when looking for something to edit fine but we've lost the ability to encode the way words are spoken the pronunciation and accents of a speaker we can get a little of that back through capitalization and creative punctuation but still it's hard in text to tell an australian from an american assuming they're both speaking english
the result of this is a proliferation of stereotypes
well say i'm writing a story about australian batman and i want to show people that batman's australian now spelling means i can't rely on his accent so i'm forced to have him call people mate and grimly refer to shrimps placed upon barbies it's the only way
attention everyone stop misusing literally
the word still has meaning okay
it is not a generic intensifier
if you say that you were so hungry that you literally ate a horse i want to see evidence that some horse lover is cheezed off at you similarly if you say that you literally ate your heart out the i want to be talking to a corpse or someone with distributed hearts i don't know
i am going to try
and i'm doing it by bringing back figuratively
exactly i'm figuratively sick of intensifiers what i want are deintensifiers words that make it clear that while something might sound amazing it's actually just being used in a metaphorical sense
that's more like it
yes unbridled optimism appears to be the order of the day
nice
excellent go circulatory system
keep on not suffering catastrophic failures
i love it when that doesn't happen
hah wow i i don't even know what form that would take
wait a minute that brain one is ambiguous do you mean my brain might not stop functioning or that it might continue to function in an undiagnosable way
okay
everyone knows i look forward to being an old man that i covet the societal get out of jail free card that being old gives you people will say oh don't mind t rex he always pees on his neighbour's flowers
 but it's because he's old
but i think my issue is that while i can see myself now young vibrant effervescent and imagine myself when i'm old crotchety petulant charmingly belligerent i don't see any in between stages the day i start going around with a walker is the day i finally become an old man and that sucks that means i'm old as soon as my body's old and it's way too late to fully enjoy it then
it is now my stated intention
and i'm going to start it by calling everyone my boy how's it going my boy
my boy when you're my age you get to call all sorts of things all sorts of things
my boy my boy my boy
myyy boyyyyyyyy
tableau vivant or tableau is a form of theatre in which the actors strike a pose and then don't move it's like a living picture it is in fact french for living picture
and i am the kind of tableau my friends check it out
 tableau
beg pardon
huh interesting
anyway i'm still the best at tableau
tableau
 i must keep the other actors from discovering my secret to excellent tableau
 it's a very competitive business
students are you having trouble writing essays maybe they're a little short
maybe just a little
well then here are some friggin' tips
okay so everyone knows about making margins wide and using a big font but teachers know that one too they see it and they think come on you can do better and then they uncap their red pens and write you could use some friggin' tips all over your cover page
nope but that's because i happen to use a little friggin' thing called tips
prepare yourself to be friggin' fipped my friend
well then
it looks like you've got the wrong friggin' guy
man i don't need that acting job anyway i can get by on my good looks and charm anyway and essay writing tips are easy
easy
for example here's a tip maybe you could try understanding the topic at hand and expressing your views on it in a clear yet persuasive manner
dromieciomimus i am shocked
what for reals
what you were the mighty thor
hello radio call in show did you know utahraptor abused the word very in all his essays
okay but did you not hear the rest of my question though
yes this will be handy for me because people is sometimes wrong
hey have you see the movie boy is dromiceiomimus ever wrong
it's uh &#8211
it's pretty convincing
that sounds like a great idea now i'll be backing away from you with my arms held up in a don't shoot position
i like it when commercials license pop songs and then make up their own product centric lyrics it's a window into an alternate corporate controlled universe
an alternate corporate controlled universe where all songwriters have brain damage
the lyrics are always so terrible and the songs entirely arbitrary it's like it's like they license candle in the wind and then have some elton john sound alike singing goodbye norma jeane
it's so representative
sure um how about
 someone's sara lee branded
it's not that hard you just imagine being good and then don't do that
man i did way better than that
man who hasn't written a story about a man with a problem for a while is it me
i'm pretty sure the answer is yes
so my new story will be about a man whose problem is he weeps all the time he's not sad his eyes just produce water like it's going out of style and he tells everyone that it's just a biological thing and he's very happy to see them but they all suspect he's sad they say are you alright and he says yes dammit i just got leaky eyes then he locks his weeping eyes with them and says what's for dinner
no man he's nice he just weeps all the time
i'm going to use it to explore prejudice what's it like to be a man of tears in a world where most men don't even like to cry at weddings he faces a lot of preconceptions
sometimes in his most private moments the tears are real
i don't know self i still kinda suspect that this sucks
it turns out there actually is a disease where you cry all of the time dacryorrhea i made it up but it already exists
this is not the first time this has happened
there's tons of horrible diseases that sound like they're just made up by somebody but actually do exist fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in which connective tissue becomes bone freezing a person in place the capgras delusion in which loved ones appear to be replaced by identical imposters and these are just the two i know about
and then there's the diseases that are familiar because they're so common but still messed up
man alzheimer's i mean i know this disease has always been an issue for me but it's so terrible and honestly it sounds like something out of bad fiction it's ridiculous on the same level as always cries it shouldn't happen
god how come we live in a world where these awful diseases exist
man these two questions better not have the same answer
 here are some more things that can go wrong with your body hypochondriacs you already have every one of these diseases there is no room for doubt
 first disease fatal familial insomnia
 this is basically what it sounds like fatal insomnia first you have trouble sleeping then you can't sleep at all then you go demented and then you die
 perhaps
 man they could inherit it
 sheep can't punch
 oooh what's this a sheep what are you going to do punch me
a few months ago i said i wanted to be a stand up comedian it turns out it's a lot of work
but guys i still totally want to be a stand up comedian
 so i've been doing research i've been going to comedy club after komedy klub and figuring out how their performers make jokes it's easy to duplicate the bad comedians but it's hard to figure out the good ones
 comedy relies on surprise i think there's a twist that makes a joke funny and i haven't figured out a generative algorithm yet
 then come with me tonight we'll go to a show
 man how do those guys do it every comedian up there was hilarious and i don't know why especially the triceratops
 i just can't figure out these these dinosaur comics
 what
 you know what it's really weird when you say that
yes
oh no you didn't
we don't need people hearing that the devil himself is now claiming credit for gta iv oh my goodness that's just what video game watchdogs want they're just realizing it now as i'm saying this but in their heart of hearts they want the devil to stand up and claim credit for gta iv i'm not letting you do that
baloney you don't even have a console that can run it
the devil is claiming credit for gta iv he wants to undermine the entire gaming industry
this stops here admit you had nothing to do with gtaiv the devil
now admit that you had everything to do with people saying utilize when they could just say use
i have a problem as a reader as a consumer of fictional and non fictional worlds my problem is this
i really don't think dreams are important
i didn't think that most people thought that dreams were all that important but i must be in a minority because i keep seeing fiction that uses dreams as very significant symbolism and the worst is when stories end on these significant dreams because in my mind i'm thinking this is ridiculous when will we get back to the real story this is entirely irrelevant and then it's over and i think oh huh
i can't nor do i want to
they're random firings of sleepy brains they're stupid stuff that my brain does to entertain itself when i'm not around to make it look at chicks or punches
never
there sex and politics
writing fiction certainly isn't hard not when you have tips
right not when you have friggin' tips
sometimes it can be hard to name characters here's a tip name them after other more famous characters and add in some roman numerals if you want to show that a character is tough name him genghis ii if your character is this big lover guy who has fallen for um a 14 year old call him romeo iv hey presto suddenly your characters write themselves
are you kidding
attention everyone genghis ii punched romeo iv on the nose
um genghis ii and romeo iv decide to take you all to the fair
when i die nobody say he's at peace now okay i'm so serious right now
say something better like i can't believe he ate the whole thing
it's demeaning it suggests that the whole point of life is to be at peace like it's this goal that we should all achieve and i'm kind of a screw up but at least i achieved it by dying it's like telling the kids who came in last in a three legged race that the real goal was just to finish
oh well that makes more sense
did you at least like my comparison of life to a three legged race
wow that's that's true
 sigh
oh mr tusks your delightful minute as in time and minute as in tiny pun has cheered me right up
i really don't understand racism i get it at a hey here's what it is level but i don't understand how someone can really be racist don't they feel kind of ridiculous
anyway with this in mind i am going to become totally racist
but in order to keep my friends and status in society i am going to be fake racist i'm going to be racist against folks who who say y'all
true plus i too say y'all when the situation demands it of me okay i'm racist against people who wear running shoes to the opera
fine no i don't
look the whole point was to experience prejudice from the inside i just need a safe racism
that's genetic utahraptor that's the worst fake racism yet
okay everyone pick a number between one and ten
hey hey
no promises
what is the deal with my ankle
holy crap
dromiceiomimus you have stumbled upon my shameful secret i i don't have a family doctor
utahraptor it's so awesome
i mean my ankle still hurts but i was looking up doctors in the area and there's so many that have awesome names there's a doctor plumber and a doctor dinner a doctor sensible
um the best one of them all
dr doctor what's the latest on my ankle
dr doctor
i like your name
the problem with superman and spider man and batman and pretty much every other superhero is that their stories don't have ends they're all stuck in the same productive age range 20 30 years old and it's easy to see why
companies don't want their most popular characters dying of old age
but the result is that their stories don't have ends we don't know how batman deals with a failing body and the rigours of old age how spider man reacts when mary jane loses her looks i mean we do because sometimes out of continuity stories explore this but they're never for real they don't count bats is always 30 again in the next story it's like david fights goliath but they keep fighting every few issues for 50 years and you never see how it ends
how so
so batman dies and the book focuses on his butler alfred working for spider man instead
gentlemen gentlemen please
yes
i've come up with a great way to make any otherwise flattering compliment totally creepy it's so easy
you just have to follow it up with i like that in a woman
an example dromiceiomimus you've got a very pretty body
now compare and contrast dromiceiomimus you've got a very pretty body i like that in a woman
there's one way to find out my friend
utahraptor you're a friendly guy i like that in a woman
wait hold on i think i know how to fix this utahraptor you're pretty gay i like that in a man
wait huh
your honour you seem very competent i like that in a woman
are you trying to be um everything that i like in a woman
ah the age old debate horses are okay
if you don't have any trains around that is
horses eat grass trains are huge multi ton machines that get things done and then when you think trains are as great as it gets you discover maglev trains these are literal hovertrains that wrote in their diaries screw it diary i'm just gonna go as fast as i can from now on and then they go 581 km/h like it's no big deal nice horses eat grass and sometimes hop over buckets
come on that's dumb
i like trains because they're big complicated machines that not only get folks places quickly but also threaten maidens tied to the tracks by mustachio twirling villains if horses could do that i would like horses too
well then i guess i'm a fan of horses
excuse me librarian do you have any books on horses
thank you pretty sure one will suffice
everyone
let's pretend the earth is going to explode at midnight tonight
i know right who are you going to hang out with if you try to reach a single person who's far away it means you can't visit people closer to you that maybe cumulatively you like more
yeah i guess i am
well utahraptor the planet is exploding at the end of the day anything you wish you'd done before you die
personally i'm going to eat a lot of junk food since who cares about heart disease now not me
man screw heart disease
man who is the dude who dropped his wallet in the toilet last night was it me
definitely not
you've got the wrong guy my friend
i've got my wallet right here
i
aw man there's probably pee on it
there are not enough internet acronyms if i want to speak entirely in internet acronyms like lol and rofl
 which i do
 then my emotions are limited only to the crudest of feelings i can laugh out loud or i can roll on the floor laughing but what if i'm chuckling what if i have a condescending smirk that fades into a distant smile of recognition what if i want to communicate the nostalgia you have for an old girlfriend when you're dating someone who's way better but you still miss her sometimes is there an acronym for that internet
immogebeaner
huh is there one for like groups of people who draw pictures of kinky sex
wikipedia oh my god has it stood for that all along
hah awesome
 why didn't they just say so
earlier today my nose was like hey t rex i'm gonna leak blood for no reason and i was all awesome
and as it turns out it is not that awesome
and it seems i bled all over my pillow during the night and then when i woke up my face and sheets were covered in blood
not really it was disturbing until i realized what happened and then it was still kinda disturbing but in a i wish i slept with someone on a regular basis because they'd be so freaked out by this kinda way
but i don't
don't sleep with someone on a regular basis anyway what's new with you i'm talking about my nose that leaks blood
sweet
uh
can i come over and
 bleed my nose on it
oh man the heart pounding out of the chest i'm in love reaction shot
second only to the i'm so angry my head is now a steamwhistle toot toot motif
if i had three wishes and the wishes had to be about cartoon stereotypes being real i guess then those are the two i'd choose the third one would be no falling when running off cliffs unless you look down and notice you're running on air because that my friends would be handy
free bridges for the strong willed
which one's that
hilarious plus it offers some resistance to machine gun fire
i'm cold blooded check it and see
my body temperature matches the environment's to within a small degree
i'm cold blooded
utahraptor
well that settles that
now on to my next topic of conversation when people say i want you inside of me isn't that weird
i i think it's weird
 sigh
what is the deal with accidentally hitting reply all when really you just wanted to hit reply am i right
there's the modern age for you cats and kittens
why don't they make some sort of confirmation whenever we want to reply to all so we don't end up doing it by mistake only that would be irritating so maybe well i'm not sure what the solution is but it sure is funny when we accidentally reply to all in a well maybe it will be funny 20 years down the road sort of way
wait wait i'm just getting to the good part
and we've all been spammed am i right it would be great if spammers found something else to do
maybe they could send us chocolates instead of email because we all hate spam
laughing in recognition is fun we all should do it right now
i don't want to be a police officer and the reason is simple
i would end up hating everyone
not only would i meet rapists and murderers kinda often i guess but i'd also regularly see domestic violence petty crime people being mean to each other chicks and dudes who punch each other in the head with knives this time and so on not cool after seeing that day in and day out i would start to suspect that everyone sucks and has a case of the illegal crazies i'd lose my optimism and faith in the world
you think so
well to be fair benny's a pedophile and he's on the internet isn't that right benny
benny look you gotta find a better name for that
you know those suicide barriers that are placed on some bridges they're usually things like closely spaced metal wires going up and running the length of the bridge to prevent folks from hopping over the edge
they freak me right the heck out
they're such a crazy symbol for our society we have them there because if we didn't members of our community would kill themselves we need physical barriers to stop this from happening if you look at it as a benchmark for our society it's so weird we have to change our environment to make it difficult to off ourselves otherwise we'd all be committing suicide what are we doing wrong
sure
but even so if suicidal folks really want to kill themselves these barriers won't stop them they'll just go somewhere else
these are symptoms we should be working on the causes
to convert to islam all you have to do is say a few words called the shahadah and then hey presto you're a muslim
this knowledge makes me feel crazy
a new religion is just a few words away dromiceiomimus i feel the same craziness i would feel if i discovered that i don't know i could change my gender by just reciting a sentence or so crazy with power
i know i know it's not like summoning beetlejuice
and yet i still feel like i've discovered the ability to summon beetlejuice
yeah it blows my mind that there's a phrase you have to say there's tests to become jewish and you can be buddhist just by saying so but islam is right in the middle no tests just a magic phrase
excuse me uh do muslims have to pay sales taxes here
what about people who hear god tell them to lose a few pounds chubbs
i've been writing a romance novel
or more precisely i've been sucking surprisingly hard at writing a romance novel
it's terrible dromiceiomimus all my life i was certain that explosions could spice up any narrative but i've been blowing my main characters up all the time and they're still not that interesting check this out antonio tony and samantha were explosive expert friends who decided one day to try kissing each other it wasn't that bad later on one of them decided that it was actually pretty bad
how do you figure
oh kay
utahraptor come quick my story's amazing
in some comics when a character is confused rather than saying anything in particular they just say a question mark
i love that shit
i mean i love that stuff i love that they have the ability to be so confused that the only response is a question mark the essence of pure confusion sometimes they also speak with the essence of pure exclamation and at others with the essence of pure ellipsis
anyway this is a skill i've developed in real life
check it out buddy
questionmark
hold on i can do this okay
$
oh my god i'd never actually pulled it off before that was amazing
$$$$$
guys my romance novel still has a terminal case of the totally sucks
i'm thinking maybe i have no business writing romantical like stories
i've got characters but no spark they're not falling in love with each other they're staring at each other across open plains in the sunset but when they finally meet up they shake hands cordially then after a lengthy silence they inquire about the weather how do people friggin' fall in love
i tried that
i ended up with erotica utahraptor and i felt very off sitting there writing about two imaginary people that i made up having sex with each other
then there can't be sexy times at all that's not a bad idea
okay i am writing romance here no sex
 alright i'll use that as the title
but that's it
today is a good day i think for assuming that there's such thing as a soul
assumption assumed
and given this assumption and the assumption that people care about exploring the idea of a soul we can easily cast ghosts and zombies as the investigation of the soul having experience that they are for what are ghosts but souls without a body and what are zombies but bodies without a soul
in summary and in conclusion ghosts and zombies allow us to explore the intricacies of soul and body ownership
it's easy
as people with bodies and assumed souls we find the idea of divorcing one from the other terrifying therefore the only way we can explore the consequences of these is through the lens of horror tada
utahraptor you were right i met a zombie ghost he wanted to eat brains but his teeth passed right through brains
i would describe him as pretty frustrated
today is a good day i think for helping folks grappling with grief from the loss of a loved one
that's right
leave it to me to totally solve your emotional problems
there are many kinds of grief so i've focused on a particular flavour when say a big meteor hits a dude square on the head and kills him that's sad however at the same time it's also extremely amazing and awesome it can be hard to reconcile these two conflicting emotions
i propose a new word
and have you noticed how it always works
today i propose a word meaning extremely sad but also extremely amazing it can be hard to pull off that emotion you don't want people thinking you're too into how amazing it was but if you say i'm very right now everyone understands grief has become easier to navigate
i call my new word sawesome
like sad and awesome
someone dropped an arrow out of a plane and it nailed my friend in the eye and it was extremely sawesome
guess who has thier first nightmare ever last night if you guessed me then hells yes that was the correct guess
a bunch of us were hanging out in a house some went outside and then a nuclear bomb was dropped in the distance and we could see a mushroom cloud in the sky i ran to the door to close it and pressed up against it as the windows in the house blew inward and radioactive dust covered us all then after it was quier and we ventured outside i ran into my friends who surved but we all agreed we'd had too much radiation and wouldn't make it it was really realistic
i know i was stoked
but then these stupid atomic zombies showed up and they started zapping us with cheap ass lightning bolts coming otu of thier eyes it was super dumb urahraptor it was that cheap 60s lightning where they just draw it directly on the film
the real nightmare was how poorly my subconscious understands zombies
that as well
someone thinks my email address belongs to somebody else they keep sending me pictures of their newborn baby addressed to one ren wellek as such i have become ren wellek
the course of my life has now been set
normally when this happens i write back the sender and let them know they've got the wrong address but this time is different they sent me four separate sets of baby pictures covering the first four days of her life i've already seen this baby grow up four days i have a relationship with her now and i've decided i'm in for the long haul
nope
i've become their silent friend ren watching this baby grow up over the years i'll see her first steps her first birthday and in 18 or so years i'll have tears in my eyes as my computer pings and her high school grad pictures download into my inbox
okay here's the news i am not your friend ren but i am just as good my name is t rex and i am a good role model i brush my teeth regularly and when i forget to i tell myself to try harder basically what i am saying here is i am a stranger on the internet who has taken a particular interest in your child
perfect
i wonder what things would be like if i could read my friend's thoughts
thanks god i totally noticed
there's no way you could know what punctuation i was using there's no way
still impossible
god knowing if i put the apostrophe in the wrong place in homophonic spoken language
i created the sentence it's fine
i am matthew broderick computer hacker
and i've accidentally wardialed my way into a secret military computer that i mistake for a game developer's machine i believe i will play this mysterious game called global thermonuclear war
kay incidentally i use an acoustic coupler as a modem and that's so retro it's cool again
holy smokes
no worries i will teach it the madness of its actions through zillions of tied games of tic tac toe
oh my god i love this movie
when i was younger i went to the dentist a lot maybe i didn't brush my teeth that well okay or that often or at all
oh well
but i remember sitting there when i was sixteen or so with some stranger's fingers in my mouth as he scraped away at my teeth and thinking man this is a sucky time i wish i had something to distract me i bet if i'd had sex then i could think about sex and that would be distracting hey i should have sex it'll make visits to the dentist easier
later i had sex later still i went back to the dentist
but it didn't work the situation was so unerotic and i was terrified of becoming visibly aroused
no i mean it wasn't the reason that was just an added bonus
it made it even more special
in fascism one person is in control of an entire country and he tells everyone else what to do he is the guy who is micromanaging his zergs or whatever
maybe this is not so bad
i mean yes it is but what if the one guy knew what everyone should be doing what if he was actually the best person to be in charge of the country
but what if he recognized that and let those people be free
exactly yes
oh i don't like those parts well i guess i don't want to be fascist after all
what's that dromiceiomimus
you're asking how much of someone's personality is determined by their body
well dromiceiomimus that is an interesting question a few years ago i would have said none but now i'm not so sure in a way our bodies do affect who we are if you've got a strong body you can be a different person than someone in a weaker body trivially a weak bodied person wouldn't make a good bully
and utahraptor you're suggesting that not all strong people are bullies
well utahraptor i'll agree with you and clarify that it's a necessary but not a sufficient condition bodies affect the life experiences possible and therefore personality and while you're questioning my premise of nature over nurture i'll clarify that i'm simply saying that someone in a weak body can't be a very effective bully
man nobody calls me anymore
if i ever turn into a werewolf i would definitely donate my still living body to science the reason is simple i care about science
guys the advances would be incredible
i'd have a body that would change shape in response to the light of a full moon that's insane if we could harness the powers of my sweet ass hairy body the advances would be incredible we could lose fat and build muscle instantly we could restore broken limbs we could help bald men not be bald anymore if that is what they wanted plastic surgeons would be out of a job
part of the research would be extending the effects 24/7
it would be a utopia utahraptor all we need is for one werewolf to be brave enough to let science experiment on him and then we can all get a little of the sweet blood fever
they should do it too
oh mr tusks i should call the police you're so cute it's illegal
recently i have discovered something that disturbs me my savings account is now less negligible than before and yet i kinda want some money
this is not the person i thought i was
when i was a kid i always thought that as long as i had enough money to live without fear of poverty i'd be fine but now i'm treating money like life points&#8482 i want the high score and i want the scoreboard to say trx at the top right above usa and ass
but what
oh god listen i want something more like number of enemies that said 'i wish i wasn't t rex's enemy anymore' frig in fact that's perfect
oh people say that's bad right do you um remember any reasons why off the top of your head
look are any sayings about how it's worse than living for money
oh my god it's him i'm sure of it it's totally him
it's the guy who picks up and spins will smith in the credits to the fresh prince of bell air
there's no way it's anyone else oh my god dromiceiomimus do i go up and say hi
but he probably gets that all the time i don't want to come across as a fan i should strike up a conversation and then mention all casually that i like his work but that i'm not a fan or anything but that might be insulting i'll i'll just admire him from a distance
screw it i'm gonna talk to him right now
utahraptor it's the guy who spins will smith at the start of every fresh prince
yep and i'm going to walk over there and talk to him right now
utahraptor he says spinning will smith every week was his favourite part of the show he said they wanted to reuse footage but he kept volunteering to do it fresh
he goes on to say that he regrets the pun but it's the most appropriate word
when people sign a prenuptial agreement they agree before they get married how to divide up the assets in the event of a divorce
what gets me is the whole conflict in them the position of i love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you with the caveat of oh baby but just in case i understand on a practical level about how prenups are practical but on the level of love i don't see how you're allowd to hedge your bets when it comes to marriage i thought marriage was the ultimate expression of love
that's it exactly love with an asterisk
i know i know that's what bothers me about it who am i to comment on someone else's marriage and yet i feel compelled to comment on tons of someone else's marriages
hey mom you know about the prenup you got when you and dad got married
i um
i got opinions
maybe i have been too hard on prenups in a sense they're sort of a love validater right
because if you have a prenup that says wow nobody's getting rich off this marriage then it's clear that nobody's getting married for the money the only reason left is love
or love the prenup is a way of announcing and verifying that you love them for who they are not for what they've got in their pants in their wallet in their pants it was a great metaphor dromiceiomimus
really
huh maybe the best way to learn about prenups is to get one oh my gosh utahraptor let's get a friendship prenup
it says utahraptor don't steal my comics utahraptor then there's a drawing of him stealing my comics with an x through it
a lawyer drew it for me
hey god quick question how long can i live without water
seriously
that's a bunch of baloney
i'm never more than a week away from death worse than that i'm never more than a friggin' work week away from death baloney
two days that's terrible that's entirely terrible listen life is stupid and i'm going to stockpile water
yeah but the remaining 30% thirsty chumps
i didn't know i had a sliding two day death window then people can go weeks without food months two days without water is ridiculous
aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
life is too friggin' fragile and when i say life i mean life in general but really i mean my life in particular
too friggin' fragile
i'm a big guy so i eat a lot which is fine except that it increases the chance that i starve to death and if i'm smaller i eat less but i also face jerks trying to eat me and if i'm a single cell nobody's going out of their way to eat me but i can die if the host i'm in dies or the stream drives up or whatever
man that too
in summary life is too fragile and i describe that as sucks ahoy
um because that's a metaphor that doesn't stop me from being food poisoned to death
your honour if i steal i get a few years in jail if i murder i get a lifetime in jail but if i forget to eat for a few days or breathe for a few minutes i die forever
the punishment does not seem to fit the crime here
it's awesome it was about a dog who didn't have super powers and then one day he got some super powers
now everyone thinks my dog has super powers
i don't know at what point we all decided that authors aren't allowed to just make things up anymore but it's totally what's happened to me somehow our fictions have all become real and write what you know is the only creative option
well they think he's so great he inspired the super powers he's actually just really angry
but that's the thing even if i write about something implausible folks assume there's a real life inspiration
yes like the day i was extra nice to the homeless
aw craps
today is a good day i think for fixing my life i'll do it by putting out a new less controversial book lolita iii this time she's 30
nobody can argue with that
in my story there's a new lolita and she's thirty and she goes out with a man who's also thirty and from a similar economic and social background they get married and have some okay times years later all the characters die of old age
i could make some changes but did you notice how everyone was clearly of the age of majority though
 gasp
he shows up again in the epilogue utahraptor you didn't even finish my book
at the end loheta addresses the reader directly and explains that if you replace she with he and hers with definitely his in the original lolita you can read all about his adventures
it's called setting up a spinoff look it up
you know what i'm tired of feeling
pain
 emotions too
but seriously guys why do we need pain
it hurts
and you can't turn it off it's like a phone that won't stop ringing whenever i'm hurt and when i answer it it's always friggin' pain calling and he won't get off the line i say yeah i get it pain i stubbed my toe and he says yeah it still hurts like a bitch can i say bitch it really hurts t rex and i say look pain i know and he stays on the line and i say pain you've gotta find other people to call you've got to get other hobbies
i'd prefer looking down and seeing that my toe is stubbed to um excruciating pain
uh no i didn't say i want my limbs to fall off
utahraptor you were totally a jerk to me just now and if you're hoping i'm going to shout after you that now i wish my heart couldn't feel pain i'm not
i'm just thinking it okay
dromiceiomimus you won't believe who i just met
future utahraptor i'm serious i saw him he looked like utahraptor but he was aged thirty years and it was the most amazing thing it couldn't have been anyone else it was clearly thirty years older utahraptor
well i was staring
and you noticed it obviously but then you turned to me made eye contact and nodded with an almost undetectable mona lisa smile just once it was this amazing nod that said don't worry t rex things will be alright everything's gonna work out fine
dear audio diary
i miss my friend utahraptor
what's that radio
street artists have moved indoors
but i have an indoors
aw man
actually it's a pretty good likeness
it wasn't me
in fact someone drew dromiceiomimus and a house and a car in my kitchen
let's pay her a visit and find out
i've got boner fever
performative utterances are things that you can say and hey presto you've changed your life and the world around you you've changed your life with words like the shahadah this is insane this is totally insane
let's do it
there's simple ones like i promise to clean your room your future is now altered but there's bigger ones like i now pronounce you husband and wife you weren't married before and now oh my god you guys you're totally married and then there's i hereby christen this ship 'hms sinkytowne' and i sentence you to death by misadventure
sure is
well
well i mean that's just our society
ah well i'm still glad we invented paper
 utahraptor was so wrong about performative utterances yesterday
 so he was so wrong
 and i only realized it after he left
 a leader declares war on television then that's war regardless of whether he's signed the paperwork yet he's changed the world just by talking with sentencing it's the same the judge tells you your sentence and that's it and the paperwork is just that paperwork recordkeeping and the same for marriages the license is just to let the government know what's already happened i was right i was totally right
 aw no seriously
 you're seriously going to rob me of my comeuppance satisfaction by admitting you were wrong before i get to point it out to you you're going to be that guy
 the guy who does what you're doing argh you are being that guy
 that's another performative you're tacitly endorsing their existence i'm seconds away from my head fading into a cartoon steam whistle and going toot toot
 i'm angry but i think it's gonna be awesome
in the 15th and 16th centuries spoken english changed dramatically with vowels changing pronunciation and moving upwards in the mouth before it we all sounded like ye olde fashioned chumps afterwards we all sounded hip and modern
it was a century of kids outcooling their parents
before boots was pronounced boats and feet like fate pretty old fashioned dudes but what's amazing is that the printing press was invented just before this started and it was at this point that the spellings of words really got fixed that's why english has so many oddly spelt words they show the pronunciation of words as they were just before we underwent the great vowel shift and decided to you know say everything differently
i know it's so amazing
linguists are like maybe immigration from the black death caused regional accents to be absorbed and then another says maybe the english wanted to distinguish their language from the hated french and then they both shrug at each other
i saw it
hey peasants tell all your friends to pronounce boner like bone air okay it'll make the future hilarious
guys so not as cool
i have a new life goal to become a hairdresser
scratch that to become the best hairdresser ever
before you go any further let me clarify that i'll be a hairdresser for mammals these guys have all sorts of hair coming out of all sorts of places i'll trim it and they'll say wow this hair cut has made me a way better looking mammal thanks for trimming the hair off my head sweat glands and mammaries
utahraptor i have nothing but strengths
dear diary
my new job is getting a little hairy
the temple of artemis was one of the seven wonders of the world it was this really big temple you guys but it was burned down arson
arsonist's name was herostratus
and the ancient greeks would be totally pissed that i just said that they were so angry at herostratus who freely admitted that he burned down a wonder of the world just because he wanted his name to be remembered that they not only executed him but they erased him from history forbidding anyone from mentioning his name under penalty of death
pretty friggin' intense
nope
it turns out you can't make a law saying dudes nobody say this guy's name anymore okay without saying his name somewhere but i mean i understand why they were upset kind of a dick move herostratus i want to go down in history but not for being the world's suckiest greek
i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
okay so herostratus burned down the temple of artemis but what happened to the other wonders of the world my friends i ask a bold question indeed the boldest i ask the question shied away from by the greatest minds of our age
isn't it true that they were all destroyed by herostratus
earthquakes huh huh i guess herostratus wasn't actually a time travelling mustachio twirling world wonder destroying villain ah well that's why pencils have erasers right
natural disasters
insurance motivators uh building complicaters domino frustraters wobbley times u s a um shakey shakes central
oh my god god is like herostratus times um five
maybe because that never happens
computers have gotten way better in recent years a new computer can beat a moldy old one from twenty years ago
fact
wouldn't it be great if rhetoric had evolved in the same way i could have this hyper evolved speaking that could convince anyone to do whatever i say as long as they didn't have similar rhetorical powers to match anyone not inured to my amazing powers of speechifying would be putty in my hands oh t rex i'm not sure i should do this they'd say and then i'd say oh maybe you should though and they'd be all awesome
rude my friend
maybe i will utahraptor maybe i'll enjoy pooping my pants each and every day
i've noticed that some songs are quite good at evoking memories and moods if i listen to a song i haven't listened to since high school suddenly i am back in high school again
metaphorically
so hey time for an experiment where i am the subject from now on i'm going to listen to a new song repeatedly over each 3 month period it'll become indelibly associated with who i am then and this way when i want to remember what i felt like from july to september inclusive fifteen years ago i can just listen to the same song again it'll all come flooding back
i know right
if it works i can go further also consigning smells and foods to certain periods in my life i'll be an old man looking up first marriage in my database and then reaching for a record player and my first bite of wensleydale in years
aw frig someone has mashed up jay z's dirt off your shoulder and the 1 1 theme from mario 3 suddenly my current crush and the death of my first dog have become irrevocably mixed
i feel very oddly about dead dogs right now
you know what i don't like
star trek
only one part of it though
i don't like when they encounter something amazing in engineering or wherever and call up to the bridge and say captain you'd better get down here explain what it is this is what people do i don't call up my friends and say utahraptor you'd better get down here and he ways why and i say oh utahraptor if only we had descriptive language if only i could describe something using my words but you know as well as i that i can only point and say lookit
i try but it's everwhere even not on star trek
the news always says up next what's in your bathroom that may be trying to kill you and then go to commercials this is psychopathic i'm the captain and they don't even want me in engineering they want me on the couch for the next three minutes of ads
i'm the captain
in conversations speakers generally try to make helpful contributions and listeners generally assume that this is the case this is called the cooperative principle and philosopher paul grice proposed it he's dead now
it's useful because it allows inferred meanings
we can be at a party and someone can say where's utahraptor and i can say he's sick and they understand that he's not here because he's sick inferred meaning if they don't assume i'm cooperating then i'm just offering non relevant information on the same level as if i answered utahraptor's got shufflepants and then clarified they're pants that shuffle when he walks
see
the cooperative principle is so ingrained that even when i say non sequiturs you're looking for a way to read it under the assumption i'm cooperating
yes
in this example i mean in real life i am a charmer of course hah i am loveable and trustworthy and good at conversations

i've had five girlfriends utahraptor
so paul grice went on to clarify his cooperative principle identifying four maxims describing how people generally communicate he called these gricean maxims
nice one paul grice
he's dead now these maxims are pretty useful though there's the maxim of quality don't lie the maxim of quantity only say enough to make your point no more or less the maxim of relation be relevant and the maxim of manner be clear brief and unambiguous these are four different different ways we cooperate with each other when communicating
yes
and arguably manner but by breaking them i look for a hidden meaning indicated by the flouting of the maxim what is so important about your and his lips i might ask myself
hah
 what
hah
 still
okay time to invent a new superhero then i'll make a movie about him and then i'll be famous then i'll also have a lot of disposable income
inventing superheroes too friggin' hard
every good superhero power is taken he's invulnerable oh there's superman okay he can be hurt but he recovers oh hey wolverine okay he can be hurt and then he dies oh batman's at this party too hey batman
i tried that but every theme is taken too
speed theme check spider theme check iron man theme totally checked there's nothing left
i do but listen i really think powers are more interesting
he's a transformer but he's also biologically human so he has to deal with themes associated with either being a man or being a soft warm fleshy and hairy semi truck filled with blood intestines and lungs
trilogy plz
 is totally amazing you guys totally amazing
it's a spark plug that was discovered encased in solid rock
so awesome a spark plug found inside a geode surrounded by material that would have taken 500 000 years to collect is this truly conclusive evidence that we will one day visit the distant past and drop spark plugs in sediment while we're at it i would argue definitely dudes i would argue that there can be no other explanation and i would argue that it's gonna be great
it wasn't
man logical explanations keep letting me down
 gasp
conspiracies
if i were impatient i'd be a jerkier person i'd always be hurrying people up and people would not want to hang around me in grocery store lines
furthermore if i didn't have my sense of humour chicks would like me less
clearly my personality is important it's why my friends like me but strokes can change people's personality and anyone can have one at basically any time it's totally ridiculous my body already has like five ways it can betray me for no reason that i can name off the top of my head and those ways are called alzheimer's old age respiratory failure heart attacks terminal boner fever and dementia it does not need another
i'm not
i'm terrified of dying totally different
excuse me stunt driver are you afraid of death
so yes
two months ago i noticed i had a small case of the chubbs so i decided to lose some weight and then i lost the weight i just ate fewer foods
guys this is terrible
nobody who's trying to lose weight wants to hear from the guy who shed pounds like they were a hallowe'en costume in july or something that is to say quickly
the point is that dieting is about commiserating and i'm the guy who shows up to the party saying guys it's not hard and that my secret to weight loss success is um eating less
how
utahraptor i'm your friend and even i hate you a little just from that sentence
yeah it took a whole lot of diet plans and and breakfast shakes
that name is totally made up it was made up by a scottish enthusiast
i'm just sayin'
anyway gregor macgregor was this explorer guy in the 1800s
in 1820 he sailed from the mosquito coast of central america to england with the news that one of the native kings there had given him 30 000 km2 of land the land was incredibly fertile the natives helpful and he'd already established an army banks civil service and democracy there you couldn't walk without tripping on the gold nuggets that littered the ground and macgregor was selling land grants at a very reasonable rate
it what
it wasn't a book
it was a wikipedia page that got boring half way through
i wonder if today is a lovely day to go on a walk
hey it is a lovely day to go on a walk
my greatest fear is having superpowers and not realizing it
oh my god i'm terrified of missing out i might have elevated strength but i never try to lift a skyscraper over my head you know how would i discover which muscles to flex to make lasers shoot out of my hands
yep i'm serious it is the worst life
i don't know i have powers and over and over again i stand by as everyone close to me gets injured or worse in accidents i could have easily prevented if only i knew
utahraptor when i die i get an award for most opportunities missed and nobody claps
 ummary and in conclusion that's how in medias res works the end
dromiceiomimus
utahraptor
oh yeah well i've got a literary technique for you my friend it's called telling off utahraptor
shakespeare add a dinosaur character to hamlet called utahraptor and have hamlet tell him off okay
what's that
shakespeare take the credit
it's over
i've met someone new
i hadn't expected the conversation to go this way but maybe
vass ess das
ridiculous what are you going to say we need to break up
 sorry it didn't work out o
that is kinda hilarious if it's like this big weiner guy doing that
you can meet people at sports
beyond me that is
fine
that's kinda sketch it can go either way but i think it veers wildly towards sketchtowne
excuse me are you jennifer klug
jennifer yes do you want a boyfriend who's only a little desperate
as a gentleman who is not afraid to say what we're all thinking i'm going to say what we're all thinking
guys we totally need a new analogy for sex
the one we have now is broken sex as hunger okay it works with sexual appetite and it works in that you want sex and then you have sex and then you're like man that's all the sex i can handle and then in a little while you start to get the munchies for sex again but that's it
but it's totally not
i can die if i don't get any food but if i don't get any sex then i just keep on keepin' on also if i'm hungry i can't lock myself in a room and satisfy my hunger with my own food that's basically almost as good as the genuine item
hah hah ewwwww gross
seriously though there are problems with the analogy
i have begun to receive insulting spam messages really vitriolic ones
ant there's not even a product to buy
 it's like it's this one spammer who got so pissed that nobody was enlarging their penis anymore that he just went off the deep end and now he's insulting thousands of people per second in the most hateful vile and terrible screeds i've ever read so awful
huh
 i i assumed it was spam because of all the spelling mistakes and because the guy's name was boorishly p foundry but hmm
 hey boorishly your name sounds made up
 hey boorishly whatever
guess who had a bike accident yesterday morning if you guessed shit t rex you are correct
also you shouldn't swear
but it was me i was biking and a dog darted in front of me and i guess it turns out i'm not a guy who will run over a dog i'll run over a squirrel no problem but i swerve and slam on my brakes and go over the handlebars of my bike to avoid hitting a dog
i get them custom made dromiceiomimus
yep
they're all um on my opposite side with now the side you can't see
hello i am late for an appointment also i don't have to listen to you
there are no scratches alright
i i just
i wanted to be the guy that swerved
tired of every day being the same as the last
maybe
maybe just a little
then maybe you should try my great idea of assigning an emotion to every day of the calendar
for example january 1st could be excited and then january 2nd could be elated and then january 3rd could be disgust
no but it's like we're aware of it so it colours the day and gives us something to look forward to every day becomes a holiday march 3rd is contentment day we'll say i hope it comes soon
i basically have
i could only come up with about 20 emotions but i doubled that by adding very then i doubled them again by adding not very and inappropriately there's there's more adverbs
i'm doing it and it's gonna be great
today's awkward day eh god knows i've already got enough of that
hah hah hah
 sigh
hey who wants to party i woke up and i said i want to party and then i gasped because it was bona fide facts
is this truly the day when everyone else wants to party as well
hey dromiceiomimus wanna party
we can party afterwards
utahraptor he'll want to party that guy parties like it's 1999 a rock star and like marty
man i even checked with god and he was all i'm busy with god stuff blah blah blah hey i'm too important to come party with my awesome dinosaur friend who am i going to party with the devil
it's um i'm not
screw all those guys i can have a fun time without partying i can have a fun time doing anything and i'll prove it
i'll have a fun time learning about accounting best practices
well dromiceiomimus i guess this really just goes to show you when you spend a few hours reading up on a financial bookkeeping there's no accounting for what you'll learn
i i guess
hah hah awesome
what's that medical school is actually very hard to get into and you're not going to let me in i guess i've been schooled
 ah
i wonder what someone studying my life for a future biography would think about me what does it mean that i spend so much time doing the things i do
and what if they got the analysis wrong
what if they saw my interest in smooching as indicative of feelings of sexual inadequacy what if they see my stepping on houses as symbolic of the way i let my rugged manly heart step on all but the most amusing of emotions it experiences
i'm just concerned that after i'm dead folks will write books about me filled with sass
explain
utahraptor you realize that you just analyzed my actions today and found meaning in them
i'm going to go write boners ahoy on a bathroom wall and then you can tell me why okay
yes it's about a guy named clarke kente his name is close to superman's secret identity but legally and creatively distinct
and then in my story clarke's looking for a girlfriend
and then he meets a woman named louise laan and then they're dating and there's some smooching and romance and it all ends in marriage the end
it's a good story it's heartwarming and the theme is that sometimes people can fall in love aww everyone loves to be reminded of that
nope nobody knows about superman
no that would be good but that's not my story my story is a simple love tale about simple people with names that are legally and creatively distinct
dc comics quit hasslin' me clarke and louise and bruce swaine are my own characters
listen if we both pretend we can both get what we want out of this conversation okay
as of today i am officially living in the future
that's because as of today i am the proud owner of a robot
his name is breadmatic 5000 and he's great his specialty baking friggin' bread
he's a robot he's a robot and he sits on the kitchen counter and when i press the breadmatic i would like some bread tonight button and then put the ingredients inside him he turns them into bread you know how he does it through robotics
robots don't have to be
breadmatic is a box because that is robotically determined to be the optimal shape for bread production okay
you live in a bland world of consumer electronics utahraptor i live in a world of robot pals who bake me food
breadmatic i'm worried the fact that you're a robot is already coming between me and my non robot friends
sometimes breadmatic in my most private moments
 sometimes i worry that i won't be enough
and
i see
t rex it's me t rex from the future don't let utahraptor read your comic because he's going to be a dick about it okay
i'm from like 2 hours in the future so yeah
it was so terrible
okay listen you're not allowed to rewrite my stories anymore prostate exam jokes seriously i stopped reading it three panels in
it sure did once i rewrote it extensively
today is the day i spend entirely in bed is this laziness no
i just want to see if i can do it
nope and to answer your next question i held it in i held it in and then i fell asleep
hey i figured it was you
but i don't have a phone by the bed so you know sorry as i'm sure you overheard i couldn't get out of bed because of self experimentation
the experiment continues
nothing mom
this is a great comic for if you need to talk to a sucky roommate but then you're like man i don't want to talk to a sucky roommate
attention sucky roommate
you may be surprised to see this comic lying around i regret to inform you that it was placed here for a reason yes i'm sorry sucky roommate but you are being kind of a sucky roommate
yes maybe if you stopped leaving your used up socks in the kitchen or whatever
 gasp
he or she isn't s/he is jsut a little passive aggressive he/she is just tired of picking socks out of the ceral or whatever
um it's way more fun to print out comics than to deal with interpersonal issues
i've always been reluctant to get a tattoo because what if my tastes change i don't want to be the guy at 50 with betty and veronica 4 lyfe tattooed on my back i mean right now i kinda do but i can see that changing in like two seconds
but i've come up with a solution
the whole problem comes from the fact that tattoos can't be altered but that's not true for example imagine i get a tattoo of a butterfly and then i realize i wish i'd gotten a tattoo of a flexing guy with guns for eyes instead all is not lost i just get a tattoo of a flexing guy using his gun eyes to shoot the butterfly and i'm the coolest i instantly become the coolest dude
well
i acknowledge i have finite room on my body for the tats but i don't think i'm that indecisive anyway once i have the enterprise shooting batman shooting gun eyes shooting a butterfly i think i'll be happy i just i can't ever see regretting that
guys i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news but well here we are i should just say it
bingo is totally suboptimal and inefficient
check it out replace the caller with a computer and you make the bingo numbers get called like a billion times faster replace the bingo players with other computers and you speed up the rate at which the game is played tie both these innovations together and you can play hundreds of bingo games per second once again something has been made orders of magnitude more efficient by simply replacing all life involved with cold and soulless bingo playing machines
nope
my new hyper efficient bingo is basically like putting in your money pressing a button and being informed whether or not you've won
but that's what slot machines do and people line up to play them oh snap is this another argument won by t rex
hey utahraptor do you remember three days ago when i totally beat you in an argument
to be honest
i'm kinda lingering on it
it turns out there are some regions where my hyperbingo tm is played neat
and it's all thanks to legal loopholes
as it happens in some areas gambling is heavily regulated but bingo is a special case that isn't and so companies have built electronic bingo machines exactly as i envisioned whats more some have used bingo as an engine to power other types of gambling like poker and slot machines the game plays a hidden bingo game and if you get a bingo your slots will always come up as three cherries it's nuts bingo's being used in ways god never intended
they cheat
say you got a quick bingo and that translates into a royal flush you're doomed to win if you throw away all your cards you're just gonna get dealt the same flush in a new suit even if you try to lose the computer will step in and change your cards or just make you win the next game
y yes
if you want to know what life on earth was like yesterday there's like a billion people you turn to more probably probably more
but if you want to know about life 6 million years ago there's only a handful of fossils
and it would be totally rad if this record was all really exceptional people like if i lived millions of years ago only i was a mutant with a fully formed extra hand growing out of the base of my spine if i was the only specimen from the time we might conclude that everyone had butt hands then and that would be provably hilarious then i thought maybe we're already doing this
well maybe we're doing the opposite
maybe millions of years ago life was awesome and surreal but only the boring specimens got preserved maybe the non chumps knew to avoid river beds and tar pits maybe dragons don't fossilize
you know what else it is incredibly awesome
it is impossible to know if my dream came true
today is a good day i think for riddles and hey look at me
i have the perfect riddle memorized right here in my awesome brain
dromiceiomimus which creature goes on four feet in the morning two feet at noon and three feet in the evening
well patrick stewart liked it
wow patrick stewart
i have filled out change of name forms for utahraptor i have done this because i am a good friend who likes to make surprises
from now on utahraptor will be known only as utahraptore
the added e gives him an exotic spanish flair utahraptore the fiery outlaw fighting for the repressed the mysterious man of dark passions the man whose smile disarms the men as easily as his rapier disarms the women who is this masked man who is this this utahraptore
come on it will be awesome
you'll get a new name and a new reputation and a new driver's license and i'll get to say oh him he's my mysterious friend utahraptore all you need to do is sign
well frig this has been a complete waste of a monday morning
frig it's actually tuesday
no way there's no way t rex is a great name and if i were to change it it would be to t tex and only if i had a guarantee of oversized cowboy hats
utahraptor the very mention of the name has filled me with unstoppable rage i get that you're trying to revenge yourself on me for filling out your utahraptore name change forms but the difference was that name is awesome shortpants is what you call a dog that that acts like a squirrel or something and i've utahraptor
where'd he go
whatever
no t tex or nothing
argh
it's tuesday
a button has popped off of one of my favourite shirts
will no one sew it back on for me
dromiceiomimus you're a good friend
would you sew a button back onto one of my shirts
but that's the thing everyone else has already learned how to do it so i'd be needlessly duplicating their efforts if i learned it myself
exactly
at the societal level
if only 25% of the population learnt button sewing and everyone had four friends then we'd expect one friend to do the button sewing when needed and the remaining three could use that free time to learn something else
society advances
i blame society
a story about a man by t rex
once upon a time there was a radical guy
he filed his taxes on time but one day the government mailed him and was like dude you need to file taxes for the past five years and the dude was like dudes i already totally did and the government guy was like hah hah our mistake but then their computers kept mailing him threatening pay your taxes letters and he felt like the problem would never be fixed and it caused him a lot of stress the end
absolutely not
fiction as a man who is attuned with the world around him i make up stories that seem real but are actually just lies that i imagined it's called writing look it up
no sir
yep you know what i'm not even fully sure what taxes are
people like different songs because they have different tastes in music this i concede
however
i still think there could be one perfect song
i think someone some day let's say me might sit down and write a song that is legitimately great a song that transcends personal taste and never gets old and is everyone's favorite without exception the best of all possible songs what would the music world be like if there were no longer any chance of anyone else having a number one song the number one song what if everyone was left fighting for second place
really
well i guess i'd better get to work huh
man i miss old gangsta rap
if you drop something heavy on your foot your first instinct is likely to scream in pain
dudes and ladies this is not such a useful reaction
screaming doesn't fix the problem it just draws attention to your bruisey foot and when your scream is followed by cursing that just says my foot hurts now and i believe this is equivalent to poo
we can do better
anything man
throw a punch yell totally intentional folks tuck into a spin to deflect any other falling items anything's better than the standard argh frig ow frig
whatever man bears do it and everybody likes bears
sometimes i worry that if i were someone else i wouldn't want to be friends with me
friendship
physical friendship
w water
why
sorry utahraptor god's hasslin' me god i said friendship at the start of this stupid conversation
dear audio diary today i looked crazy and didn't get a lifetime supply of gold or water i blame monotheism
hey too bad you've got no other gods to complain to huh
hey god you know on star trek when sometimes they go back in time
it interferes with my ability to enjoy the show
seriously though it ruins my suspension of disbelief
the issue is they're traveling back in time in an understood repeatable way slingshot around the sun it's just why wouldn't they do that all the time when anything bad happens whenever there's tension and the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance i always think well worst case they could just go back in time and fix this i wonder i wonder why they don't do that
utahraptor exactly
well i mean not exactly metaphorically it was a good metaphor by exactly i meant to communicate utahraptor that is an exact metaphor
okay good alright i'm going to go back to talking about star trek now
attention everyone that was pretty much all i had to say actually
you know those guys who have been hiccuping for 70 years or whatever i'm glad i'm not one of those guys
hiccuping forever is this weird sort of forced immortality
it's true but on my own terms i can't control hiccups so it's really being remembered for something that my body's doing that's really incidental to who i am you know anyone who heard of me would know me as the hiccup guy and it would overshadow anything else i did with my life
true
but the headlines would still be hiccuping doctor cures cancer it's too memorable to overlook i like choosing my own destiny
utahraptor that reference has instantly inspired me to be the best i can possibly be
yes yes let's do that holy crap
yes i know what that means
ill advised hookups
it's the wedding experience you get some single people together who think life is a race and then you convince them through the medium of wedding that the only way to avoid coming in dead last is to get married the result hookups
hookups of the ill advised nature
lame and sexy
utahraptor guess what
i'm still totally gonna be on the lookout for bad hookups
um i'm thinking that a lot of my internal conflict and malaise comes from the tensions between the life i actually want to live and the stories i'd love to be able to tell
i am a man who when he is at an all you can eat restaurant will restrict what he eats based on his peers i don't know when to stop so i rely on the verbal and non verbal cues of my dining mates to tell me when i'm full
i call this condition appetite asperger's
it is a hilarious and excellent name because people with appetite asperger's analyze the behaviour of others while eating and come up with a ruleset for saying when they're full just like someone with real asperger's only instead of applying this to social interaction i apply it exclusively to knowing when to say wow dudes i'm full how about you guys huh pretty full oh my gosh me too
normally i would have
but i made a list and i've already got like four or five t rex's conditions plus appetite asperger's has assonance going for it
and i'm still not comfortable with the full range of my sexuality but we all have to make do
that's right everyone
today is the day i share more about myself than maybe i wanted to
 done
 i'll never say
 i've read greek myths man i know you guys are all about sneaky tricks and irony and morality tales in which dudes get wicked punishment for basically no reason i don't want to be in any noun based morality tales not unless the moral is t rex is the best holy cow you guys
 god wants a noun
 i was accusing him of the whole ironic punishment greek god thing but he's not so bad i give him a hard time sometimes
 hey god you want my word here it is
 meritocracy
wow that was a terrible movie definitely one of the top 50 worst films ever
ridiculous
there's still bad movies anyway most worst book ever lists have mainly modern entries despite thousands of years of book history
how are you measuring volume sure ancient books are lost but we generate so much text today that it's probably a tiny percentage overall
you have to include web sites emails spam
well
what a terrible movie that was i'd definitely rate it one of the top 50 worst films of all time
oh god
so sometimes archeologists find things that don't belong in their geological contexts shells where there were no oceans that sort of thing and there's lots of explanations like maybe an animal ate it and pooped it out gross
but sometimes these objects are found with human remains
and when that happens they call it a manuport something that was carried by hand by ancient dead dudes manuports are neat because they show you what ancient dead dudes found interesting and the most awesome manuport is the oldest one called the makapansgat pebble it dates to 3 million years ago
nope
but there were protohumans australopithecines and the makapansgat pebble has this natural eye eye mouth face shape on it a protohuman had enough curiosity and aesthetic sense 3 million years ago to see the face in the rock and thought it was special enough to carry around with him until he died
i think it's beautiful and amazing that millions of years later another human being dug up the same pebble recognized the same face and maybe even for a moment dreamed the same dreams
that's um that's beautiful too
me sense of proprioception
that's the sense that lets you know where your body parts are at any given time
and it's also a sense that gets dulled when you drink which is why you have trouble touching your nose with your eyes closed in such situations you're forced to rely on proprioception and with it dulled you miss you poke out your eye with your hand or whatever
proprioception
maybe
oh it's true but i messed up i'd really prefer losing nociception the sense of pain
yessssss
a sense of future sight dudes
i could look around and say in ten minutes it's going to rain
but then the downside is that if i saw a car accident i'd be duty bound to try to prevent it and plus once word got out about my awesome power whenever i was with my friends and they tripped or whatever they'd blame me they'd sit on the ground rubbing their knee saying thanks t rex with ultimate sarcasm when they were the clumsy chumps
maybe my mouth was full
maybe i was warning someone else to my left maybe risk is part of freedom and by protecting my friends from all possible danger i stunt their growth and become the single greatest threat to their own self realization
also maybe the guy tripping was hitler
that's right utahraptor i'll say i'm friends with hitler to win an argument
it is the reverse godwin and the most powerful debate technique ever
hey is it fubsy in here it feels like it's fubsy in here are you wondering what fubsy means god
 short and stout squat
i was using it incorrectly
it's just it's such a good word i wish i had more chances to use it would you say you're fubsy dromiceomimus
are we truly the fubsiest
what
fubs oh my goodness i have to get a dog so i can name him fubs
from now on he's fubs his subtitle is the angriest dog in the world
aw man who peed on my couch i bet it was fubs
hah hah hah fubs
it's still good
time for a funny joke everyone alright alright
okay so this man gets into a car accident and wraps his car around a telephone pole
and there's this passer by who is um passing by and he happens to see it he rushes over to the crumpled car and says oh my god are you okay and the guy says well i get by
the driver misunderstands the question he thinks it's about whether or not he makes enough money to get by in today's difficult world
sure they do
hah i think i get it listen i'm gonna basically commit parts of this joke to memory
it is common to imagine your life as a story with yourself as a main character it's a story with no real climax that always ends with you totally dead
however
my issue is that stuff happens to main characters dramatic stuff stuff that's not always good it would be fun to be a bit character a guy who gets one or two lines and whose personality is encapsulated in a few words 'likes boats' 'old and wise' or 'eats a lot and therefore can't control himself around food when someone says where's the beef he runs up and says did someone say beef because that is definitely how people who like food act '
then i was thinking maybe i am that
yeah but it's rosencratz and guildenstern right i've got my own life but it only counts when i'm around the main character everything else is forgotten
 dromiceiomimus
dromiceiomimus are you in
i like boats
everyone
guess what
i'm pretty great
i'm serious i was thinking about it i'm a great friend i'm smart and i'm fun and funny and i've been a success at every job hobby and challenge i've tried
dromiceiomimus let's put modesty aside for a second and just rap person to person i think when we do that we can agree there's nothing i've done that i haven't excelled at
we're putting ego aside today utahraptor
i'll do better utahraptor i'm going to come up with a clean safe cheap efficient and powerful renewable energy source that cures cancer
later
after i go home and succeed at thinking of a better comeback
i think we can all agree that as a popular culture shifts with time there were some years that were great and there were some years that were way terrible
for example
hilarious
however i have studied the past 2000 years and come up with the definitive cultural low
yes utahraptor i have gone all over 2000 years and found the global minimum the exact day when north american and indeed world culture reached its um opposite of zenith
yes and it's the day after the film forrest gump was released july 7th 1994
frig
that's really obnoxious
frig man frig
frig
i've got one thing to say dromiceiomimus do you know what it is
frig
probably
oh nothing frig
nothing i want to talk about anyway frig
yes frig frigs and dangs drats and cruds heck
 frig
it occurs to me that as a single man every romantic relationship i've ever had has ended in breakups
i think every time i remember this i'll swear a li'l and feel bad about myself
super nintendo
nope super nintendo
sorry i said the snes was the best console ever because i never had one and they looked fun
hey perfect
did you hear that utahraptor says the sega genesis was the best ever did you hear that
did you hear that

friendships come to an end
that's easy dinosaur comics is a comic about dinosaurs but fellas would you believe
dinosaurs that talk
yes i know it is amazing to think of
can it be explained by scientists
you there help a brother out
this blows i will never know the answer from a real scientist if every body here is a dinosaur
utahraptor i have questions that need answers
he's right a cure for aids thanks for nothing science
no
i don't know what to think anymore
brainstorm
i'm going to write a comic about my daily life
hello droce dromecimu dromicemomice
hello friend
that is nice to say
oh thank you
i have for you today the sexiest dinosaur comics story of all time it is sexy
it starts like this
but it was sexy right
see lonely infinite buildup a confusing instant of climax that's over before you know it and then a long slow slide into disappointed despair
man
you cannot deny that was a sexy story
what will science be like in the year 65 000 000 friends i am here to tell you many amazing advances will be made
think of how far we've come in just the past one hundred years
and the pace of innovation is only accelerating consider that ipods from only five years ago are now ludicrously unacceptable when in history a person might own a single record player their entire lives it is certain that in the year 65 000 000 marvels dwarfing even branded consumer electronics await us what new and fundamental discoveries about the universe are ahead will our personal holographic media players also accept phone calls
explain
utahraptor
the new macbooks have cases that are made out of aluminum
guys i have some bad news
i don't think i'm cut out to be a law abiding member of society
when i see illegal billboards my instinct is not to call the city and register a complaint my instinct is to tear it down and when i see a jerk sitting in a parked car at night projecting an ad on the side of a building i don't want to call the police and report a citizen acting against the best interests of every other citizen with the exception of himself i want to disable his projector and by disable i mean fully destroy
yes
it's a small enough issue that i can understand it fully and it's a problem i can solve at night with my fists i can't solve global warming at night with my fists utahraptor
don't even say it i can't
attention anyone who has a large carbon footprint do you want to be punched
see this is exactly what i tried to tell my friend utahraptor
emotions are embarrassing and should be hidden in polite society euphemisms are used to avoid the shock of naming feelings directly
for example instead of saying i'm happy you can say i fell off the wagon the wagon is sadness and my mode of transportation but i didn't hold on hard enough
he always seemed to have an abiding sorrow
 my heart has developed boners for this
there's no need for that crass language you can just say dudes check out that house please and the dudes they will understand
a nobel prize for excellence in the avoidance of frank discussions of feelings my heart has developed so many boners right now ladies and gentlemen
every book is written by an author
is this truly the worst form of racism
every book is written by someone right my point is that the system the man is set up so that anyone who doesn't want to be an author can't write a book ergo racism ahoy
well by book i really meant t v show
okay you know what at least i'm looking for racism
prejudice at least i'm not complacent and ignoring issues and just sitting around with my eyes closed eating cupcakes
 which actually sounds like a fun time and is something we should definitely do soon
i have come up with an excellent way to celebrate hallowe'en a date auction
featuring me
and since it's hallowe'en the prize is not only a date with me t rex but it's a hella creepy date with me t rex i'll arrive two hours early stand perfectly still across the street and peer into your window with binoculars i'll ring the doorbell while pressing my eye up against the peephole i'll ask you how your day was and whenever you use the pronoun i i'll suck my fingers i will be only moderately discreet about it happy hallowe'en
because of charity it's all for charity my good man
well alright then i guess i'll just end up dating someone who wants a hella creepy date with a stranger
aw come on you only bid like $20
it's just
never has one man sucked on his fingers so much for so little
i am a man who says frig a lot on account of how it's part of my irresistible charm but guys it turns out there's a norse goddess named frigg she's odin's wife
best life ever
see dromiceiomimus i was going to say best goddess ever but the fact that there's a goddess frigg has immeasurably improved my entire life frigg she can see the future but doesn't tell anyone what she sees so hen someone stubs their toe they can say aw frigg and that is definitely probably where the expression comes from
there's even a plant known as frigg's grass so awesome
utahraptor
i think i'll never be this excited again for the rest of my life
let us cherish this moment
utahraptor there's a city called batman in turkey i could have spent my life in batman city becoming a master in the study of frigg
if this isn't the final nail in the coffin for leibniz's we're in the best of all possible worlds argument i don't know what is
you know what maybe leibniz is right and we're all doing pretty okay maybe this is the best of all possible worlds
except for the fact that ice cream costs more than vegetables
and except for the fact that way more people on the face of the planet care about the economy than they do about buying me presents
that and except for the fact that entropy is always increasing and in the end all life in the universe will be still dead and frozen forever
oh wow maybe
how depressing would it be to know you're part of the reason things aren't perfect to look in on the best of all possible worlds and notice you're not there
i'm so glad we named it frigday instead of friday
attention naked and sexy yet non exploited members of the attractive sex i know
whenever i think of the phrase good to the last drop i think of the friggin' maxwell house coffee
i don't even drink coffee
they have lexicalized the phrase and associated it in my mind with their stupid branding
and if someone says can't get enough of that sugar crisp not only do i think of sugar crisp i think of the jingle too
what they store a phrase in my sparkling mind and now they're abandoning it i call friggin' shenanigans on that
um refer to it as sugar crisp till the day i die
except then i'll just be reinforcing their original branding okay tell you what i can't forget the slogans but i can substitute their brands with something i do want to remember like intercourse
exactly silly rabbit intercourse is for kids wow
that idea backfired incredibly quickly
i've made the best conceptual hallowe'en costume ever this year check it out
i'm someone from the past
no no sorry i should have specified i'm from the recent past like past three years i'm walking around saying oh wow check out all these incremental improvements
um lots of the politics
actually i'm someone from three years ago who also didn't follow the news
 yes
i am about to
hey utahraptor i'm dressed up as myself from three years ago
because i'm still kinda cheesed about you tearing apart my 2008 costume and in the intervening years i have become only slightly better at expressing myself
while riding my bike yesterday and making a totally legal move from the side of the road into traffic so that i could make a left hand turn this car dude honked at me
so i flipped him off it was bicycle road rage
it was insane i never get road rage bicycle or otherwise and i never flip anyone off but here i was being all that i hate i flipped him off without even looking behind and then after i flipped him off he honked at me again two little ones and i flipped him off again two little ones then i turned left and got away
i am certain of it
what else could he have meant
huh
excuse me everyone you saw what just happened what do you think that driver meant to convey
mom i was asking the other pedestrians
someone who doesn't vote is clearly super chumpy but on the other hand someone totally uninformed who votes anyway is ultra chumps too
an interesting conundrum
so let's take it to extremes if voters were so uninformed that they were effectively voting randomly then their noise would drown out the signal of informed voters so that's bad
agreed
so let's just multiply everyone's vote by their informedness
exactly that way the goodness of a voter will directly impact how much their vote is worth
dear audio memoirs today i was racist by word substitution again
this
this is the hardest racism not to be
how great would it be to be able to make your voice sound like somebody else's
super great
probably because then i could do prank calls as you dromiceiomimus i could call utahraptor as you and invite him over for dinner and then when he shows up for dinner you're liable to be unprepared for company
i um
okay as revenge for that i could prank call dromiceiomimus and pretend that i'm a celebrity she likes
well i've actually got an emergency super secret prank that i won't talk about in case i ever do get the chance to pull it off
the ultimatum game is an economics game thing two anonymous strangers have to decide how to divide a sum of money between themselves
player one proposes a non zero split and player two can either accept or reject it
if two accepts they both take their money and go their separate ways but if two rejects nobody gets any money and the game is played only once so there's no worry about reprisals
that's what's so interesting when there's really unfair offers 90/10 99/1 some players reject them anyway
exactly
exactly and that's something we're not all motivated by greed some of us are also motivated by pride
attention retail establishments hallowe'en is barely over
let us bask in the afterglow a bit before rolling over and kissing christmas
the worst part of this is that even complaining about the early commercialization of christmas is pass it's like airline food the zeitgeist has already moved on to acceptance and their chefs do good work under difficult circumstances and i'm left saying hey notice how this sucks though
i know
i'm experimenting with it
i figure if everyone is gonna accept insanely early christmas marketing then i'm just going to sexually anthropomorphize the holidays that way when people encounter christmas marketing the disquieting thoughts they got from me will at least make them aware of it
what have i wrought
today is a good day i think
 for a treasure hunt
okay so in 1958 these two us air force planes were doing training exercises with a real nuclear bomb for some reason and they crashed into each other and one of the planes was so damaged that it had to jettison its bomb above a bay in georgia
serial number 47782 baby
aw man nevermind
perhaps you missed the scenario in which i use it to blow up pollution
today i will be a patron of the arts yes that is a classy thing to be
women love patrons
they love 'em
hey dromiceiomimus have you noticed the arts lately i have and as a patron i find them to be very engaging and artistic on several levels
um the one where the woman is surfing
whatever i can come up with painting names later
what screw that my disposable income is all earmarked for one purpose
that purpose is to make me happier
through the purchase of things
that only serve to make me poorer
i'm gonna stop talking now and re evaluate some decisions okay
ladies gentlemen everybody stop what you're doing for a sec
i have gained access to a cake
let us divide it among us so we each get a fair amount yes i will divide exactly into thirds
fine what if i divided it so that no one would wnat to trade their piece with someone else that's fair that's envy free baby
how is that not fair
that's one person keeping the whole cake nice try utahraptor
fuck it's strawberry cake
today is the day i find i'm no longer immersed in popular culture i used to be submerged in it but now i'm not even in the lake i'm on the shore dripping wet furrowing my brow and pointing at the lake in confusion
today is the day i realize that saying something rocks is actually really weird
it's like a switch went off in my head this radio station was all bragging on itself saying kewl 105 we rock and my first thought was like a moored boat is it cool now to sway back and forth like a boat tied to a dock by a length of rope
that's the thing my first instinct was to take it literally i had to remind myself what they really meant
then i thought of rock concerts and it seemed silly but punk rock seemed adorable
i know you're trying utahraptor but it sounds to me like you're saying i should pitch dangerously to one side a little more often it's too late for me tell them my story
we did by god we did
hey when i decide that cool can only mean something chilly you'll still shoot me with the kryptonite bullet right
awesome
awesome
today is a good day i think for surprising my friends
 with breakfast in bed that is
oh dromiceiomimus you're already out and about
i see that's cool i guess i guess you can do what you want with you life
man you're already up too
this is the last time i try to make you guys breadfast in bed okay you suckers don't stay in bed long enough to eat a delicious breakfast surprise
um maybe if you were lazier and hungrier
i would like to cancel my order of thirty hash browns please
then why do you have a drive through
guess who had their first dream of flying last night
gentlemen ladies calm down please it was me
i had but they were always dreams in which everyone else could fly and i couldn't you know the one where everyone realizes they can fly by jumping and flapping their arms but when you try it you just hop a tiny bit higher than normal and it's kinda cool but everyone else is flying so it's not that cool
come on man
we already agreed dreams sounds hella symbolic when described if we want to talk about their contents we have to move past symbolism
okay so i was wondering in case i get this dream again where do you fly when you dream about flying
utahraptor
please continue
yes because if he dies then the money that shows up will make us say perfect this is exactly as much as i valued that guy
what
oh god i'm definitely going to jail and it's all utahraptor's fault it's his revenge for all those arguments he los
because when he dies the police are going to ask who stands to gain and now there's a giant million dollar arrow pointing right to me signed and notarized insurance policies are instant motive just add death
still no good my friend
your insurance company still saves a million dollars if they can somehow make it look like i murdered you they'll be there hands cupped around the policeman's ear whispering listen i am almost certain this green dude killed him and made it look like old age
utahraptor
my fears have been reduced by precisely 80%
yes maybe sometimes you don't want to throw the fact that you've found happiness in the arms of another in my face maybe you need some euphemisms
for example
instead of saying sally and i are now dating exclusively you can say sally and i are now seeing other people only with regret on second thought maybe you should keep the sally and i are now dating exclusively because if i don't want to acknowledge your commitment i can play dumb and say sally and you are now dating exclusively axe murderers mad scientists um dogs
yes allow me to correct that
instead of t rex we're dating t rex we're eating an awful lot of picnics on sundays t rex we're hanging out more than can be politely explained away t rex we're playing mega man in two player mode
not for us utahraptor not for us
 sigh
you know what's freaky ghost ships ships sent sailing and found drifting weeks or months or years later and everybody's gone
totally spooky dudes
i think what i love best about them is their aloneness how everyone aboard was basically removing themselves from larger society expecting to be reintegrated when they arrived &#8212 and then something went catastrophically wrong all we can do is piece things together botched mutiny rogue wave everyone accidentally turning invisible and mute and also incorporeal if you are overly credulous then it is impossible to say for sure
it's the sea
a boat can float along for years without crew or sails or a working engine but if everyone disappears on an airplane it's not like we'll find it still flying around years later
fine
um even in the heady realm of fantasy i don't see how this could happen
okay today is the day i go down in the record books for being the first guy who who um
 who ate a tractor
aw really all at once or in li'l bites
hello that's the world record for longest time taken to push a disabled tractor through a stupid digestive tract that doesn't count
and if it does count why stop at a tractor
forget that noise i'm going to eat something way bigger and show that stupid tractor guy how it's done what's something bigger than a tractor the box the tractor comes in
perfect
dear audio diary this afternoon found me with my mouth wrapped around the brick corner of the library suddenly wondering if this was all life held for me
later i had cupcakes
here are some simple ways to improve your life
 don't die
i know i know
but i don't have any simple ways to improve lives try being lucky don't make bad decisions if you're about to do that always be healthy um somehow maybe don't be a crazy racist
excellent
maybe you should stop being such a crazy racist
deus ex machina is the most excellent of all literary techniques because it's the only one where god shows up and says hey fellas what the heck's going on and then solves all the problems
and it doesn't even have to be god anything that comes out of nowhere and solves all the problems counts an early example is in macbeth where lady macbeth is totally guilty over the murder she masterminded but then she remembers her time machine
act v scene i lady macbeth is all out damned spot out i say oh wait here's my time machine
i'd like to know where you buy yours
everyone knows that macbeth ends with lady macbeth going back in time and stopping the murder and then she and macbeth go to the future which is the 1800s which is actually the past now
shakespeare spends pages wildly inaccurately describing life in the 1800s
i'm glad you decided to add time machines to your plays shakespeare
sure you are
midas was a king who was nice to a friend of the god of wine and so he gets a wish from the god of wine nice and so midas wishes that everything he touched would turn to gold
instantly the ground he's standing on transforms into gold
the gold change races across the planet's surface and down into the mantle like a shockwave transmuting it instantly in seconds the earth's iron nickel core becomes pure non ferrous gold and the planet's magnetic field is lost unshielded from solar wind every living creature begins to absorb desperately fatal levels of radiation the soft gold of the planetary crust is unable to sustain the weight placed upon it and begins to buckle and distort
midas watches in horror as his planet dies a golden death
the moral is not to make wishes like that king midas
attention people who are breaking up with someone don't say it just wasn't meant to be okay
you are greatly complicating your breakup
because now instead of simply saying hey listen for my tastes you are way too sassy you are saying hey listen okay there's this all powerful invisible being who controls everyone's fate and he's or she or it or they it's hard to say and nobody really agrees has got plans and intentions and a particular interest in us not being together
occam's razor people occam's razor
i am
besides honesty can help the dumped person improve they can say maybe my sassiness is at all time highs instead of saying geez i wish whoever controlled our fates would stop being such a dick saying dick really loudly so the fate controlling entity is sure to hear
you don't need god to dump someone oh my god utahraptor yes
so gravity happens because matter bends spacetime and blah blah blah but dudes i had a crazy idea what if instead of gravity being a property of matter it was a property of the entire friggin' universe
have all minds within the sound of my voice been completely and irrevocably blown
so check it the universe is suffused with tiny invisible particles that travel in equal intensity from all directions so if you were alone in the universe you'd be hit equally from all directions and nothing would happen but if there's a planet in front of you then any particles coming from its direction are going to hit it instead and not you so you're no longer in balance and particles coming from behind you will push you towards the planet
yes
no because they're &#8212 massless
they're &#8212 energyless as well
everyone in the past needs to stop preemptively plagiarizing my ideas
i keep saying that but it keeps happening it's total crap
i have a great idea for a comic you guys
okay so there's a single panel with three stand up comics on stage each in front of a microphone talking and smiling making gestures that sort of thing and in the foreground there's a guy in the audience who's whispering something to his friend and the caption says what's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding tada
dromiceiomimus if you liked me you'd be laughing
yes that is why it's hilarious
argh
oh my goodness i just figured out what i was meant to do with my life i have discovered my calling
body farm owner
forensic anthropologists want to study how bodies decompose in different circumstances and so they go to their neighborhood body farm which is basically just a few acres of land surrounded by a fence and filled with dead and decomposing bodies some are out in the open others are underwater or entombed or whatever and scientists come and science up the joint and i'll be the guy who holds a torch under his face and says welcome to my farm of death and decay
i'd only say that sometimes utahraptor
 security issues what's better security than living in a house surrounded by corpses oh hey let's go steal the tv from the corpse house nobody has ever said that utahraptor
honestly utahraptor if you keep being so down on my body farm idea when you die i might not let you decay out in the open on my front lawn
okay so this game is called guess two thirds of the average we all pick a number between 0 and 100 and guess what 2/3rds of the average of everyone else's guesses will be
the winner is the person who guesses the closest number
so let's say everyone else chose 100 you'd want to choose 66 67 because that's 2/3rds of 100 but the catch is you all choose your numbers at the same time and don't tell the other players
exactly
yep
but assuming the other players know that too
guess two thirds of the average guess two thirds of the average
pick me
guess two thirds of the average
dudes
there are a lot of friggin' religions
and let's say you're a lady or fellow who thinks man heaven sounds like okay times i've got to get in on that action but you're stymied because which religion should you choose there's like a billion different ones and if you bet on the wrong horse then no heaven for you chumpy
my friends i have the solution the t rex system
you overlap each and every religion in a venn diagram
then you just look for the place of maximum overlap and follow the precepts there say you discover most religions say something like give to the poor you know that by doing this you're maximizing your heaven potential&#8482 for hundreds of religions at once plus you're not wasting time on crazy and unpopular precepts
um here's another hypothetical for you utahraptor what if all gods exist and when you die you could spend your time in like 80 billion heavens at once
i have kissed a lady i have seen plenty of beautiful sunsets i've even driven a car through a fruit stand during a car chase
 what's left
this my friends is the malaise of the glutton at life's buffet the man who achieved too much too soon he looks ahead his life not half over and sees no more frontiers to conquer no more challenges no more surprises all that remains is a slow slide into compromise and old age the long december spent waiting for the day his mind and body finally fail
then death
well
i guess i could do them in order
one in seven canadians is living with a disability
but one in seven canadians is also productively employed in the agri food industry
it's especially impressive after i tell you that one in seven canadians is a senior citizen
but it's not all sunshine and roses utah raptor
one in seven canadians also has alcohol related problems suffers from insomnia arthritis skin cancer and has seriously considered suicide
don't worry one in seven canadians will die of an infectious disease before they can suicide plus they'll leave money to charity
zombies versus vampires they're the new pirates versus ninjas verses ants that combined themselves together to form the shape of a giant ant
and the question is who would win in a fight
unfortunately the question is ridiculous because zombies and vampires have no reason to be fighting vampires drink blood and zombie blood is all decayed and pooling in their feet they wouldn't be interested correspondingly zombies eat brains and vampires
 okay maybe they would fight sometimes
obviously
if you're bitten by a zombie then you become a zombie so all the vampires would eventually be vampire zombies
utahraptor
i wonder what it's like being a ghost immortality coupled with incorporeality seems like a potent combination is it truly 24/7 party times
there's one way to find out
excuse me god what's being a ghost like
okay but what's the difference between you and a ghost then
i've no evidence that ghosts can't do that
i was saying i don't have any evidence that ghosts can't create universes maybe they just choose not to you know maybe they've got enough hassles without adding a whole new universe on top of them
nevermind
god it would be more convenient for me if other people could hear you
god we will definitely have to agree to differ on that one
cave painting check renaissance era painting check astrolabe from the age of discovery stuffed inside my computer check
it appears i have finished decorating my house
it is but here's my angle let's say there's a catastrophe and everyone dies when future folks dig up my house i will throw their historical understanding into chaos they will say how could a cave man own a renaissance era painting and a computer with an astrolabe stuffed in it frig history is ruined you guys
they might
but then worst case they'll think wait nevermind this dude just had supremely excellent taste
yeah either way i win
attention future generations
i'm still calling that a win
the best way to revenge yourself on an animal is to eat it
everyone knows it but they leave it to me to say it out loud
and this is the problem with vegetarians if a cow sasses me i can say oh yeah well guess what wise guy i will use your flesh for digestive energy but vegetarians just take it and then cows have no idea who they can get away with sassing and let's face it they're not the smartest pickles in the fountain so they sass everyone and then i end up eating a lot of beef
it's not that big a problem
you haven't
utahraptor it's so satisfying you're like my feelings are hurt but soon i'll be full of meat wow i feel better already
okay you're coming with me and we're going to sneak onto a farm
holy crap sheep have rectangular pupils
what the hell what the hell
ahhhhh
 t rex she said i'm in love with you she gazed into his eyes smiling i thought differently about it and it's definitely because you're so handsome and intelligent
t rex laughed
 baby he replied it's also because i am sexy and loveable and smart and manly and sexy she was nodding he paused looked around and then whispered i put 'sexy' in twice because i'm twice as sexy she whispered back the two of them whispering it together she knew that he was twice as sexy as a regular sexy man that was probably a good thing for their relationship he decided better that she know now than be suprised down the road
 no that's not what happened
 um that's not what happened she said wiping her mouth t rex realized it wasn't vomit it was
 woo
 awww daaaang
people say to me t rex what do you want for christmas this year i have the perfect gift idea
peace on earth
i'm serious people say this a lot but they're always adding a oh hey if that doesn't work out remote controlled cars are just as awesome which while true also supplies an out by only asking for peace i'm forcing my entire network of friends to try to get it for me it turns negative consumerism into positive world change plus if anyone pulls it off i get to raise my hand in the new utopia and say awesome this was my idea
yes please
utahraptor it's christmas if you told me what you wanted i would get it for you no questions asked and i'm telling you i want world peace
peace please
utahraptor
it's christmas
i need to get the best present ever for utahraptor this year and that present is clearly a um a
a spouse
it's the best gift if things go well then years later people will say how did you two meet and he can say t rex hooked us up for chistmas best gift ever and then they can high five
i'm doing it
yes god on
hah
upon closer inspection that was actually more a gift for me than utahraptor
yes i don't know how it happened but it's true wikipedia is a woman now
and she's super smart too
you ask her about frogs and bam she knows all about them and then you ask her about trains and she's all did you mean the band the album the bavarian village and i'm like all of them i guess it's great it's kind like dating god
utahraptor awful
we were in bed and i kissed her and i asked her about herself right to set the mood and she swore at me but then she took it back and then she yelled hitler was right but then she took it back and then she showed me a picture of a wiener but then i said you know what i think i'm done asking about you
later i asked her about christmas and she told me santa wasn't real
today is the day i bring back the word daffy
no not like the duck
it means crazy
and it used to be a good adjective until daffy duck showed up and stole it and now when i say daffy everyone thinks duck he only wants the adjective for himself he got greedy
there's plenty of guys named bob but i can still float in a volume of water without everyone suddenly reminiscencing about those dudes
yes no
look i just want to be able to use daffy again i want to say what a daffy car that is and have nobody get that far off huh i wonder if they're still putting daffy duck on mugs look in their eyes
yes they are still putting daffy duck on mugs
i am making my own daffy duck mugs where when you put hot liquid in it it says daffy is also an adjective and not just a duck
also
i shouted too much and my voice got stuck this way
our letter to professor science comes from me i write
 dear professor how do i know which food that i ate got turned into my eyes
i really thought i wrote that one better wow
anyway what i meant was this how do we know what food we ate contributed to which parts of our bodies put simply professor last week i ate a salami sandwich i have but one simple question is that salami now my brain
unsatisfactory
i want to know precisely where my meals will end up before i eat them you know what my dream is my dream is to pick out a lobster in a tank and say oh i'll have that one the one on the right yes have him boiled i will consume his flesh i will turn him into eyeballs
i have a new science question professor
is &#8212
is it wrong to want things that are terrible
i found out about the best word yesterday frigorific it means cold with this word i can now finally say the sentence daaaamn girlfriend that was totally frigorific
i have always wanted to say that sentence
you know what screw those guys man i don't even care if it was their word of the day last week it's my word of the day today
anyway who trusts a word of the day chosen by the publisher of a dictionary
it's ridiculous it's like asking kellogg's what their cereal of the day is hey here's a hint i bet it'll be a cereal manufactured by kellogg's
their dictionary not the dictionary there's like 80 billion words they've never heard about
see i couldn't find sexplosive mathemagician backne or ambisextrous
utahraptor no one has ever said that about ambisextrous
okay so we've all evolved from lesser beings and in order to continue the species we have a genetic imperative to reproduce
and this is probably why sexin' is fun times
and i'm told that when you hold your newborn child in your arms for the first time this is a transcendental and joyous life changing event sure fine i totally believe you but why are these pleasures just related to reproduction why can't i have the joy of having a child without actually having to have the child
it's my understanding that children are really expensive you guys
genetic engineering it's so easy
let's just replace the biological imperative to reproduce let's give ourselves the same joy and wonder from an egg sammich as we get from first holding our child in our arms let's make gum as deeply fulfilling as watching your child graduate top of the class dean's list summa cum laude bubblegum flavour
who said anything about not having sex the whole point is you can do both at the same time
 boo hoo this is tasty boo hoo i'm also enjoying this sex as well
i am a generous guy if someone wants to go in front of me in traffic i slow down and let them in
but it's all an act
 i let someone cut in front of me for two reasons because i figure this way it's more likely they'll do the same for me in the future and because i recognize that it helps the traffic system as a whole but this isn't generosity it's greed it's well presented greed it's me selfishly wanting to get around quickly so badly that i'll sacrifice the short term for the long term
i'm not
i'll ask if you want the last piece of pie before i take it but again that's just me selfishly wanting friends and knowing that actually showing my greediness impedes that otherwise i'd be gobbling it like crazy
that's true and and that means as long as they're still around then i'm not the worst person ever oh my god now i have a perfectly selfish reason to be thankful for all the jerks
you're such a good friend utahraptor
yep
it's not that hard you guys
someone comes in and says boo hoo i have trouble with one or more of my relationships and what do i say i say how does that make you feel and they say sad and i say but talking about it makes you feel better right and they say a little i guess and i say excellent case closed
when i say case closed i make eye contact take off my glasses and dramatically slam closed the book i'm holding
i wear them when i'm a relationship counsellor silly
from bad relationships obviously
via their ears i would imagine
everyone there's no need for all this fussin' and a feudin'
oil is totally a renewable resource
we just have to give it time okay we'll all go and do something else for a while when we come back there'll be oil everywhere the place will be rotten with it and then we can stuff that into our cars okay
of course not
today is what would things be like if we had lifespans of millions of years guys let's pretend day
only if you're not participating in today's theme
hey since we live for millions of years let's go make some staggeringly beautiful art that can only be created by synthesizing thousands of years of experience hopes fears triumphs and failures into one transcendental expression of life
let's say you're playing chess with someone and suddenly they have a fatal heart attack this is the best possible way to win you guys
you have kicked their ass at chess so hard that they died
it doesn't matter if you were losing when they kicked the bucket you've still won with the best finishing move possible and what's more your victory is so awesome that it completely overshadows everything your opponent ever accomplished during his life people will say sure that guy may have cured cancer but he lost so badly at chess that he died every version of his obituary will end with checkmate
i'm not
okay i am but it's a small hope
yes exactly
i'm not a terrible person utahraptor if you died playing chess i'd be sad obviously but also happy because i kicked your ass straight to the grave
 let us pause here and remember how truth and honesty are the foundation of any social relationship
what is love love is a strong positive emotion of regard and affection it was a silly question to ask because the answer is right there in the dictionary
but that's too easy we have to complicate up that business
maybe we'll insist that love can't be defined that it's beyond the reach of rational thought that we fall in and out of love in a way that is completely beyond our control all we can do is hope for the best and hold on for the ride because it's cupid's arrow straight through the heart striking anywhere at any time it's a lot like an axe murderer or a brain aneurysm or a stroke or dementia
love is just a feeling a chemical state we don't need to deify it
i've got nothing against romance you can still be romantic while maintaining that love is an understandable emotion just be rational and don't do tons of stupid stuff and use i was in love as the justification that's not love that's responsibility deflection
excuse me
i just think that
 i am a fan of knowing things generally the more things you know the better prepared you are for someone asking hey do you know all about 18th century literature
 because then if you know about 18th century literature you can punch them aside and say obviously
 but it occurs to me there are situations where ignorance is bliss for example imagine if you knew all about how the worst moment of your life would go down you'd spend a bunch of your time saying aw dang that's still going to suck
 true okay but say you knew the best moment of your life
 okay but say it's passed so it's all downhill from here on out
 fine
 i knew it why
you know who hasn't written a screenplpay for a while
but especially me
and that's going to change right now
okay so the scene opens in a spaceship and it's the future the ship is this huge mechanical leviathan all pipes and metal catwalks unfriendly imposing and it's drifting in deep space the engines have overloaded and blown up this is all explained in the opening musical montage set to louie louie
um no it's science fiction drama louie louie is just a really good song
so after this dramatic montage we're on the bridge where the captain is
well he's a gruff man but he knows his spaceships his name captain flannigan o'spaceships
yes he's yelling status and there's a dramatic strings version of red red wine playing it's a very tense scene
true but sir i think you'll find that you're forced to agree this isn't most screenplays
all funny t shirts use the same unmodified t shirt canvas
slogan on the front and maybe on the back sometimes
forget that man let's kick it up a notch or two let's break free of our self imposed t shirt boundaries
layers dromiceiomimus sequences
beneath an i'm with stupid shirt wear another one that says no not really
exactly and beneath that another shirt that says if i was standing next to a visible minority with the other shirt i didn't mean it and i apologize beneath that you guys i'm not actually racist beneath that it was just the unfortunate juxtaposition of my shirt from 4 shirts ago and a person
i was inspired when i saw a racist person stripping
i thought wow if only they'd been wearing the shirts i just invented
most of shakespeare's life is a mystery people spend their time reading his plays and saying man this guy has dudes sailing from cities that are days away from large bodies of water
 he must not have known geography that well
 therefore he must not have travelled that much i have uncovered a fact about shakespeare's life and then they're happy
that's exactly my point we're reconstructing it from hints subtext deduction and innuendo from his works i can use this
in my own life
i'll write plays that hint at how great i am how smart and sexy and awesome everyone finds me then i just excise every other mention of myself from history and the plays are the only source left they're the only way to learn about the towering mind behind them this adonis of authors this t rex
please my first play is called the motorist who spewed racial epithets while also spewing vomit
 it was inspired by an actual motorist i felt terrible about and for
so god
i was wondering what happens when you die
no no i mean what happens when the rhetorical you dies
what happens to me when i die me myself
argh never try to have a theological discussion with god
all i want to know is what happens when i die
alright that's it attention everyone i have an announcement to make i don't know when people started using brain as a verb but i find i am forced to give it my full endorsement
i think it would be a great idea to write a really convincing essay praising plagiarism and have significant parts of it plagiarized hilarious
looks like this thursday morning just got filled up
ahem plagiarizing is the act of plagiarizing taking someone's words or ideas as if they were your own that's from the dictionary dromiceiomimus i plagiarized it
fine
 how do i love plagiarism let me count the ways
ah you mean like plagiarism the final frontier
 but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and plagiarism is the sun
 deep into that darkness peering long i stood there plagiarizing fearing
any machine that travels through time has to be a machine that travels through space as well i've been saying this for years
because dudes the earth is spinning on its axis
and it's whipping around the sun and the sun is rotating in the arm of a galaxy that's also whipping around the universe you go back in time without travelling through space you're likely to find yourself alone in the vacuum millions of kilometers behind the earth you left a relative instant ago
huh
oh wow this means that if we can travel through time then we can also scientifically prove whether of not someone is actually the centre of the universe
science keeps surprising me in surprising new ways
so let's say i'm a painter and i've studied really hard and i've worked really hard and i've become one of the best painters in the world hooray except there's one problem
there's nowhere to go but down
i've got no new frontiers to challenge do i quit while i'm ahead that seems like a waste of all effort or do i power throgh and continue painting as my body begins to fail trying to recall my earlier successes as my work inevitably declines sliding towards self parody
explain
i have a confession utahraptor
i was 10 the last i painted and it was muscley dog doing the splits and i'm sure leonardo could have painted it better and i'm pretty sure i'm talking about the ninja turtle there
aaaaand now i'm certain of it i am speaking of the ninja teen
it's tuesday everyone let's talk about our bodies
wooooo
okay my body is big and tall and it has many hidden surprises i wonder which one you'll discover next
it's not oh gosh oh gosh i didn't know that smell could exist 24/7 there's good surprises too
honestly i don't see any flaws
i used to be better at imagination
if i had lived in the past i'd have different beliefs because i'd have nobody modern around me to teach me anything else
fact
and i find it really unlikely that i would come up with all our modern good stuff on my own running around saying you guys democracy is pretty okay also women are equal to men and racism kind of a dick move if i was raised by racist and sexist parents in the middle of a racist and sexist society i'm pretty certain i'd be racist and sexist i'm only as enlightened as i am today because i've stood on the shoulders of giants
okay good
but that doesn't make me a terrible person right we're judging the past by the standard of the present
right so that raises the question is everyone from that period in hell or is heaven overwhelmingly populated by racists
don't you mean this is why you shouldn't think about religion that hard
i have been assuming that our development as a people is linear moving generally from less to more permissive it occurs to me
maybe that isn't always the case
maybe 100 years from now people will look back on us and say man i can't believe they permitted lifestyles different than my own current lifestyle sheesh
aw man do you really think so frig i'd be totaly pooched i've eaten so many friggin' animals
yeah but i'm totally the worst
future folks can munch on a carrot look back on us and say they were wrong to eat so many tasty animals fine but then when they see the caliber frequency and verve of my animal consumption they'll spit out their carrots in surprise and teh carrot chunks are 99% guaranteed to spell out the words history's greatest villain
that's true man
the future having different opinions than the present is making it really hard for me to be popular across all possible timelines
hey everyone let's kick up our metaphors a notch okay it's time for 800 pound gorillas to become 1000 pound gorillas
10 000 pound gorillas
it's time for us to do things three quarters assed or deci assed if we're doing something femto assed then why are we even doing it at all
we can do whatever we want dromiceiomimus we can gently tap on the ice we can rub our cheeks on the ice we can smash through the ice with a superheated nuclear bomb
and i don't see how that's possible
we will not be rolling in dough utahraptor we will be snowboarding down mountains of dough dough will splash up and get in our eyes we will have to go to the doctor and we will say you can keep what you pull out of my eyes doc these days i'm snowboarding down mountains of the stuff
why didn't he compliment my metaphor
what's so great about being an adult
let's consider
adults can eat whatever foods they want but also have to pay income taxes and manage personal finances which is boring and stupid
adults can own grocery stores but also have to face the long slow of their body mind and self
yes
adults can pilot helicopters but also can marry poorly
utahraptor
 that one made me sad
here are some things that are sad
abandoned puppies and little birds with a wing in a cast aww
and then you throw in an orphan with a crutch and a little girl holding the limp string and rubbery plastic remains of her only birthday gift this year a balloon with the words happy birthday naseem printed on it the girl's name is jenn
brackish swampy water and it was tossed to her without warning and now she's drenched
yes
a scientist runs up explaining that dogs and birds can't cry but as she examines the animals she discovers that in addition to tear ducts they have also evolved the ability to experience sadness with an intensity previously unknown on the planet the end
here are some things that are joyous
puppies and little birds with tiny adorable wings
and then throw in a happy little girl with a bow in her hair to play with the puppies and the birds ooh and give her a bright blue balloon that's printed with the words congratulations everyone on curing all diseases
and her third balloon says also we replaced hate with snuggles
yes
joy has been distilled into a useful gaseous resource and everyone's so happy that it's basically infinite we all keep being joyous and our balloons keep getting more full when they pop it's not with a bang but rather with the intimate sound of a lover's sigh at the end of a rousing session of sexual congress
secrets
do we keep them in order to keep relationships running smoothly
do we share them to cement friendships treasure them because we value knowledge and if the knowledge is privileged then it's even more valuable create them because we are all hopelessly duplicitous and our public faces and private personas can never be reconciled
yes
those who keep their failings secret appear more perfect and so we too keep our shames private in order to bring ourselves up to this impossible standard
 no one must know i peed on the wall
 no one must know i bet utahraptor peed on the wall though
flash forwards are a useful storytelling technique they happen when you
frig we're all dead
get the hell out of here dromiceiomimus the contamination is right behind me
i didn't let is loose it let itself loose it's self aware i'm sure of it but all it seems to be aware of
no god damn it no
it takes over our minds our bodies how do you fight something like that
leave me alone leave me alone you monsters
 jump ahead to show where actions might lead it's foreshadowing taking off her negligee
and i wish you wouldn't interrupt my sexualizin' utahraptor
plot twists are when you think the murderer was the cape guy but then it turns out
 the murderer was actually this other cape guy
they also happen when a plant is revealed to actually be a ghost plant or when oedipus realizes he's in oedipus rex and then stabs out his eyes
 gasp
twists upon twists
it's true
sometimes they happen in the middle like in romantic comedies when the female lead says you know what i'm just not that into not being inmy giant robot suit and then she walks around in her giant robot suit
and then mr darcy shows up in his robot suit and he holds up a sign that says forsooth i had forgotten i ownned this robot suitte
holy crap utahraptor would it be a plot twist in my own life to spend all my time rewriting out of copyright books
dudes it's time to impress my friends with my expansive vocabulary

okay shoot i know i had something planned here what word was i going to use s standard
i maybe
standard tastic
that's not a real word
okay but the first time actually someone uses that word the world will end
i bet that i could be an amazing ballet dancer in fact yes wait yes
yes i'm certain of it
oh i know that's not what i meant i meant i bet that had i spent years training i could be an amazing ballet dancer
oh of course
my true meaning was i bet that had i the body type circumstances inclination talent and training i could be an amazing ballet dancer
yep
well i bet that i could be an amazing um guy who walks around and talks shit up
guess who's two hundred years old today charles darwin
he invented evolution
what
today is the day darwin's remains turn two hundred years old
fine
today is the day the raw material in darwin's body which has since passed back into the earth and likely been reincorporated into many life forms since is two hundred years old
argh
 ladies and gentlemen of the jury i appreciate you giving me the chance to address you this whole thing started
 yes
 i'm really excited about this dromiceiomimus
 i know and the best part there's nothing illegal about it
 sure
 the more the merrier
 i am too i think this will be the best team essay on the significance of friendship in early eastern literature ever
 so in summary and in conclusion ladies and gentlemen of the jury
 um i'm actually not really sure why i'm here
okay so let's assume you know the position of every air molecule in the room
things are going pretty well for you my friend
someone in the room says something to another person and then they both leave assuming you know exactly how they moved when they left and therefore how they displaced the air then any remaining displacement is due to sound waves by looking at the location of the air molecules in the empty room you can reconstruct what was said in the past dudes it's a perfect undetectable listening device
lots probably
oh really
let's say i break the law but i had a really good reason for doing it maybe i'm batman
maybe i'm batman
so maybe i'm batman and i break the law and i get caught but i had a really good reason i'm going to hope that the police take that into account i'm basically going to hope for selective enforcement of the law but that's kind of a terrible thing to hope for it puts the law in the hands of an individual police officer with all their preconceptions and prejudices
not hardly
that fails to consider extenuating circumstances like the fact that maybe i'm batman so i'm stuck i know it's useful to allow the police to make exceptions but i don't want my freedom dependent on whether i get a nice cop or a mean one
s several
 some people who have never kissed before worry what if i'm bad at it my sweetie will never want to kiss me again
 this is entirely reasonable
 in the high stakes world of kissing there's just no room for second chances luckily for anyone i can teach you how to kiss you simply whisper the inside of your mouth looks a little dry lock mouths with your partner and then you flood them with your saliva
 that dromiceiomimus is a very peculiar way to pronounce erotic
 i call it the inundation
 no wait the deluge the monsoon no the happy swamping
 fine
 utahraptor
 i renamed it to the oral overflow
deinococcus radiodurans is one of the most radiation resistant bacterium ever it can also survive dehydration exposure to vacuum and acid being thrown in its face
it is the t rex of the animal world
you give this guy enough radiation to kill a dinosaur and it survives then you give it 500 times that dose and it still shrugs it off dudes are friggin' nigh invincible against radiation just like or so i suspect myself
yep it pulls this off by protecting its repair enzymes from radiation damage and by keeping multiple known good copies of its dna
exactly
why would bacteria evolve such effective protection against an entirely nonexistent threat
unless of course the threat actually exists
 the immigrant experience
 what's the deal
 well if you ask me i'd say it's the experience of immigrating if you will to a new country coupled of course with the emigrant experience of leaving your old country behind
 i'm in over my head dromiceiomimus i've totally barely ever immigrated
 fine
 i'll go learn about immigration okay and then i'll return here in exactly 24 hours and dazzle you with the nuances of my new hyperinformed opinion synthesized from my own reactions to the many viewpoints i've encountered alright
 excuse me do you guys have any movies about the immigrant experience it's an emergency
 starring robocop
 maaaaaaaaaan
my new book is called billy the teen billy was the teen who loved being a teen
 it's aimed towards teens
so after clearly being established as a teen billy goes off and meets some other teens they become friends and they hang around outside fast food restaurants and sometimes they go in and get some fast food from the restaurant later billy announces that he just plain loves being a teen all his friends nod their heads in ready agreement
a few pages in billy realizes his 20th birthday is coming up
he'll no longer be a teen it's a disaster he's terrified he's waking up in cold sweats billy's certain that when he becomes 20 he'll lose something vital of himself
and then he dies of a heart attack
but like 50 years later you know long after he's come to terms with everything the vast bulk of the book details billy's entire adult life and the last page says the actual title this book is 'mr bill peterson who came to terms with his life over 60 years'
attention people who are hunting jobs you are know as job hunters and guess what i have some tips for you my friends
tip number one is to have a good email address
if i were an employer and i had two equally qualified candidates but one resume came from colin@businesssuccessislifesuccess com and the other resume came from colin@chumpstakingdumps com i know which one i'd want to hire
it is without hesitation
that business success jerk has the most obnoxious email address ever
no man the other guy surveyed the field of resume email addresses and said you know what it can be done better i'm fascinated by him who is colin and furthermore what of his chumps who it seems are presently taking dumps i don't know but i want to offer him a job to find out
hah hah awesome
 it's not the guy i made up though
i am generally a pretty easy going guy but guys there's this one thing really boils my potatoes
tweeting
okay i get that you're using twitter super but i really don't get why we need a new verb for that all tweeting means is posting to twitter it's got the same meaning as post except this verb can only be used in relation to a single corporate website that's insane corporations invent nouns all the time and i can accept that but verbs really is updating twitter so different than updating any other website that we need a whole new word for it
sure have
man friggin' english friggin' lets me down friggin' again
also
 i do believe that last sentence let me down as well
somebody please write a really popular song about me okay
and make it really catchy okay
and make sure all the lyrics are really positive stuff like oh t rex you're so fine
a #1 song all about how great i am it's the best pr imaginable folks'll meet me and say you're t rex suddenly arousal washes over me as unstoppably as the ocean tide
once this song is written i will anyway
impossible i'm certain that this song will be so good that for the rest of time folks will forever say
hey hey you across the street
daaaaang
you know when people say oh my gosh what if dreams are the real world and this world is all a crazy mixed up dream
attention everyone you should not listen to these people
if the dream world is real then the real world is the one where stuff is crazy all the time where people are always showing up for their public speaking engagements naked where things are stupid and then really sexy and then stupid again and in this insane universe people are going to bed falling asleep and having entire consistent dreams about checking their email
because it's helluva stupid
any universe so insane would self destruct before its inhabitants had the chance to go to sleep and dream of filling out dream income tax forms for dream income they got at their dream job dream there is used in a pejorative sense
so apparently in the real world my friends are swarmed by zombies the zombies then advance on me and my response is to scream charge them and then instantly fall into rem sleep and wake up here
i say again stupidest universe ever
parking tickets
everyone who loves parking tickets throw your hands up in the air raise the friggin' roof
ah so everyone's stealing my anti ticket opinions instead of raising the roof that's fine that's cool
but i hate all those things too have i never had an original thought in my life
 phew
dudes
why are there not cyborgs yet
every day we're closer to the future and yet every day i have to watch movies to see a cyborg rebelling against purely organic life instead of just looking out my dang window it's just i don't want to have to sit my grandchildren down on my knees pull them close and tell them that our generation dropped the ball so they'll have to be the ones to pull out their eyes and stuff the holes with cameras and little red leds
this is what i'm saying
nope as the sayings go claims of cyborgnicity are lies until you can see incandescent red eyes and all cyborgs are null until you can see a chrome gleaming partially exposed skull
i have always thought them to be remarkably poorly constructed sayings
cell phones built into your friggin' hands
it's the future
you'll think hey i wanna call ricky and then digits will glow on your palm you punch them in and then make your hand into a phone shape talk into your pinkie while listening on your thumb and when you're done you just mime hanging up that's the future my friends cell phones built into our friggin' hands
um in the future it will also be very easy to pretend you have a cell phone
what's that

is that racist
okay so i've been down on poems in the past i may have been heard to remark guys poetry bloetries but i've just discovered
poems likely predate the written word
it makes sense when you think about it before writing the only way to keep track of something is to memorize it and if you're memorizing something in poem form then you can automatically incorporate structure to the language say rhyming couplets and that structure gives you something to jog your memory if you forget the result is that structured narrative poetry can be much easier to remember than just free verse
yes
and this is why i feel bad i didn't know that i was making fun of one of the elder gods of language i thought i was making fun of the smelly dog who pooed
i promise it
the smelly dog who pooed
i think the smell comes out his nose
conceptual metaphors are those that allow us to understand one idea in terms of another they inform the language we use when talking about all sorts of concepts and are almost subconscious
for example life is a journey
people use this metaphor all the time all talkin' about going places in life getting a head start in life being at a crossroads and so on it's so entrenched that to talk about life using another metaphor seems odd for example saying i've saved $3 55 in life sounds weird but only because i'm using the much less popular life is a discount store with sales that can occasionally be taken advantage of metaphor
oh tons
 burning with desire and warming up to someone that's affection is heat falling behind at work before catching up schedules are moving objects you're in my way get out of my way and arguably i've lost my way that's the classic direction is a bucket that people keep sneaking into
in conclusion cognitive linguists love conceptual metaphors because they allow us to describe direction as an intensely desirable giant bucket
the end
lampshade hanging is when you've got something hella dumb in your story but then shakespeare shows up and says forsooth guys that's dumb and then the audience accepts it
because who would argue with friggin' shakespeare
shakespeare has drawn attention to the hella dumb and in doing so addresses and placates audience concern
it doesn't hurt if a random character says that's dumb i'll listen but if shakespeare says it i'm spitting out my drink and saying wow shakespeare i'd better listen to this line of dialogue right away
shakespeare you should have a line that says forsooth if this were in a play i'd want my tuppence back
ssh come closer
i know yet more secrets
yet more secrets of the medical profession
okay so let's say you're a dude or lady who often is called upon to perform cpr on someone in cardiac arrest nice you're a handy person to have around when performing cpr you're aiming for 100 chest compressions per minute but this is an awkward rate to hit however if you hum queen's another one bites the dust you'll be fine the song is simple catchy memorable and has a steady beat that runs as it turns out at exactly 100 beats a minute
quite possibly
and if i ever need to perform cpr on you you can bet i'll be belting it out at the top of my lungs
no worries man i've got your back listen it'll be a great show
although i might change the lyrics to hey there guys
we share the laughter and the tears utahraptor
guys there are basically a billion different ways to make new friends
okay there are at least two ways to make new friends one way is to look at the friends your existing friends already have and then pick out/up the most awesome ones from those this algorithm allows you to grow your network of friends in much the same way that any number of deadly diseases reproduce
true
and that brings us to method one online dating
not necessarily look up profiles find someone interesting and date 'em and then say that you just want to be friends kapow instant friendship that'll last a lifetime
no deceit with me baby i use the lines sincerely
if i just want to be friends i just want to be friends and if i'm saying it's not you it's me then i'm also saying frig man i've got to go pull myself together i'm dropping the ball here and it's really not fair to you
 p s let's make out
there are tons of phrases in the english language that i can never use because they've already been claimed by someone else
what the heck english
if i want to give a very serious and momentous speech about the history of war i can but if i also want it to begin with now this is a story all about how some lives got flipped turned upside down i can't it is a perfectly awesome introductory phrase that is forbidden to me unless i'm cool with my audience and being distracted by thoughts of young willard smith fresh prince used scorched earth tactics when withdrawing from the phrase
it doesn't work
even if i'm ignoring it my audience won't know to i'll be explaining the origins of conflict as hard as i friggin' can but they'll all be hopelessly distracted by thoughts of chillin' out maxin' out relaxin' all cool and all shooting some b ball outside of the school
the history of war is a journey a narrative a story that at its core is all about how some lives become turned upside down by conflict flipped if you will
frig it's still a reference
alright everyone
let's do our friggin' taxes
woooo
so um it appears taxes are not as fun as i expected
dromiceiomimus i expected nothing less than the fun of a job well done
man who can say
there's no feedback at the end no b+ try harder next time no purr fect work sticker and then there's a picture of a cat
there's just the knowledge that audits can happen for any reason and the knowledge that there's no statute of limitations for tax fraud even accidental and that the only other crime with such status is murder
woooo
did you know that st patrick used to be associated with the color blue
it's true you travel back in time to the 1200s and you say what color goes with st patrick and they'll answer blue eventually first you'll need to figure out how to communicate with the people there their vowels will sound all crazy to your ears plus assuming you're in an english speaking part of the world and there were a lot fewer of them then the language was way more germanic than what you're used to
you're right in the middle of middle english my friend
but not until the 1400s so if you're in the 1200s and nobody understands you you could always wander around find another dialect group and try again
anyway yeah now st patrick's color is green
i have no plans for tonight will this truly be another night of staying in solitude and quiet contemplation of my life thus far
forget that
dromiceiomimus let's do something tonight something awesome
something anything we're awesome and we have disposable income why do we have dull evenings why aren't we taking helicopter rides to the grocery store why aren't we white water rafting into our friggin' jobs
not true

daaaaaamn
man i'm not old i do tons of stuff that's not old people stuff do old people knock back extremely sour gumballs like they were regular gumballs
if they do they're not doing it around me
do old people stomp on things in their way instead of walking slowly around them do old people solve their problems with their fists i have never seen an elderly gentleman solve problems with his fists
then you must not've been looking dromiceiomimus my left fist is called plan b because it solves so many problems
 plan c
it's put into action in the event that plan b fails only it's never been used because plan b never fails
yep i'm young because my body parts still have nicknames
 man it would have been way funnier if i'd nicknamed my weiner plan b every time someone said let's take a close look at plan b i could've laughed and laughed
 sigh
if someone were to ask me what my favourite suffix is i would answer them without hesitation cracy
it turns anything into a government
if you really like sandwiches all you have to do is think sandwichocracy and hey presto your ideal system of government is right there if you love yourself an autocracy is what's perfect for you mister and et's say you love action figures
why the heck not
any day my friend
you could say hey imagine something awesometastic and i can say wait imagine an awesomeocracy instead and then everyone will imagine my thing instead because it's better plus cracy includes tastic all sandwichocracies are sandwichtastic but not all things sandwichtastic are a sandwichocracy
i would tell you it's been a rousing success
let's say i decide to say a word only once in my entire life that's a hapax legomenon
hapax legomenons are words that are only said once by someone they're also words that only appear once a book or even once in the entire records of a language like gopherwood it only shows up once in both the bible and in the entire writtern record of classical hebrew that's one heck of a hapax
nobody knows it's a kind of wood probably
it's there because god's all noah build an ark out of gopherwood okay but now we're all what um maybe he meant cypress wood did somebody transcribe this friggin' poorly it's cool how unlikely we are to ever discover anything new about a hapax
yes its precise meaning will forever remain a mystery
it's not that hard to be creative but sometimes when i come up with a joke i find out it's already been invented in the past and it's always by the same dead guy i now have a beef with this dead person you'd best watch out
 oscar wilde
man oscar here's a guy who's been taking the credit for tons of great jokes that i would have come up with if he hadn't done so first telling a border guard i have nothing to declare except my genius i totally would've come up with that if it had not already been come up with i'm not young enough to know everything that probably would've been my bon mot wilde's the most egregious preemptive plagiarizer of my funny jokes ever
pretty sure i am utahraptor
huh okay i'll be the guy who's mad at all the unwarranted credit wilde gets then
frig
 i'm going home to never do anything original again okay
what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger
is that medicine
i know it doesn't work in all cases or maybe even most cases but it works with vaccination right a weaker version of the disease teaches your body to fight the real deal so what i'm wondering is if i ate something disgusting does that you know level me up for some really insanely disgusting things in the future
both i guess
there were some dead moths in my cereal this morning and i'm hoping there's some way i can turn this into a positive event
attention please everyone i've done some reading about the brain and i discovered there's a part of it called the amygdala
and the amygdala is responsible for fear response
this is amazing i had no idea fear was localized to a single location this opens up whole new avenues in the field of toughening up the very scareable just open up their brain and remove their amygdala and it's an instant fearectomy they'll wake up from surgery shake your hand laugh in the face of danger and then get business cards that say physically unable to experience fear
only analogously
hah not a problem you know all i've ever learnt from feelings
 being sad sucks
i know that getting a transplant is serious business and that it can be a traumatic event
but it's also kind of awesome
if you've got a transplant it's like you've leveled up as a person the rest of us are stuck with the genes we were born with but you've got selection you're made out of the best parts of other people
it's the best way of looking at it plus anyone who's had a limb or organ transplant is way more mysterious
listen i can tell you what my left hand has been up to for most of my life
but if i had a transplant i'd have no idea there'd be a part of my body with a whole different history than the rest of me how is that not awesome
i imagine it'd raise some issues of what awesome things my hand has been up to
oh man imagine if my liver came from an axe murderer mine would be the liver that's dangerous to know and my philosophy would be if you're not interesting at least have parts of you that are
 hey do you want to swap feet sometime

no what news
amazing
man
really this isn't just an apr
maaan
yes i do
this is a total reasonable thing for us to do it is entirely plausible even if you meant it as a joke let's just do it let's go visit the chocolate factory
maaaaaan

instead of april fools' day we ought to call it disappointment wednesday
here are some phrases that we need to be saying more often cats and kittens
see i'm already helping
people should compliment me on my smokin' bod more often i will gladly do the same
thank you dromiceiomimus you have a smokin' bod as well
and how
nothing bad ever happens when you eat the whole thing you guys it doesn't matter what thing it is i've never had negative consequences from doing this
none that i care to remember utahraptor
hey it'll be better for all of us if we just find out who's doing it
hey here's a fact power ballads are the best sort of ballads fact
bill medley and jennifer warnes have had the times of their respective lives they're each the one thing the other can't get enough of this could be love dromiceiomimus
never
intense
once upon a time bonnie tyler was falling in love but now she's only falling apart
hello it's a total eclipse of the heart
lou gramm wants to know what love is he also wants to feel what love is finally he wants you to show him what love is
lou gramm ladies and gentlemen
so i am a guy who is really afraid of going crazy i don't want to go crazy okay guys
okay
and i think i've figured out what part of my fear is about causation there's tons of mental illnesses where we can't find any reason for them to be happening and have no idea what's causing them nobody knows what causes schizophrenia you can just wake up one day and say oh damn dudes i've got schizophrenia how is that not terrifying
what no they're not
seriously
oh my god being a physical being is such total baloney
today is the day i remove the word prejudice from my idiolect and replace it with the word racist
yes
now if someone says t rex i just don't like apples i'll say hey that's racist and when they say what that's not racist i'll reply with the very fact that you're denying that it's racist is even more racist
will i be the most popular person ever i can only speculate that the answer is yes
oh my god so racist
everyone can hate apples not just minorities the very fact that you'd jump to that conclusion shows that you truly are history's greatest racist
maybe next time you can do it by not dabbling in racism
attention audio diary
nobody comes to my friggin' parties anymore
am i ever prepared for a mid life crisis i'm seriously ready
bring it on
dromiceiomimus i'm awesome if i wake up one morning and think what have i ever done with my life have i ever really accomplished anything oh god then that thought will be followed by wait i forgot how awesome i am nevermind
impossible a mid life crisis is a crisis of confidence and if there's one thing i've got it's confidence
yes confidence in who i am what i've done and where i'm going and if there's two things i've got it's confidence and a bunch of burgers to eat when i get home so do you wanna come over and eat burgers tonight or what utahraptor
excellent
if there's three things i've got it's confidence burgers and the mantra that as bad as today gets soon my stomach will be brimming with beef
a creation myth frig
that's what separates me from most major religions
dromiceiomimus you gotta help me i need a creation myth
no no it needs to be epic it needs to stand up against stories from every religion ever
better
and yet somehow worse
yep
i got it thanks
today is a good day i think for thanking my friends for their friendship
friendship tuesday everyone
dromiceiomimus i'm really glad we're friends i like how we hang out and i like that we've shared so much together so thanks
excellent
and i'm glad we're friends as well utahraptor
super i've never said this but i love how when you come over for dinner you always bring some wine it's old school classiness
i haven't forgotten i was just um going to thank everyone else on the planet first
pleased to meet you
dromiceiomimus i had no idea that horses was available as a last name me horses i could be mr horses why was i not told i could be mr horses
yeah but i didn't know horses was an actual option we live in a world where horses is a real last name how''d i miss that one
they're alright they get by
please when would i ever be likely to see him again
omg my god
i can't believe i totally forgot how awesome your name was
i'm going to say the word baloney so everyone who doesn't want to hear the word baloney should stop listening because here comes the word baloney
taste is kind of baloney you guys
delicious food is delicious no matter how good or bad it is for me wouldn't it be so much better if how good a food tasted to me depended on how good the food was for me chocolate would taste worse the more i gorge on it until i stopped out of disgust and if i haven't had any vitamin a in a while carrots would taste like friggin' manna
sure
but it's a feedback loop your own body is training you on what it needs through the medium of taste eventually you'd know your own nutritional needs by pure intuition
this is what i'm saying
wow everyone should've just listened to me in the past because i still totally agree with what i was saying
it seems that despite the euphemisms available to them folks are still discussing feelings in a frank and straightforward manner please you know why our ancestors crawled out of the ocean
i'm pretty sure it was to avoid these talks
with that in mind i now present more euphemisms to allow you to get by in society
for example instead of saying i feel afraid you can say aw crap i think i've discovered a weakness in myself and instead of i love you just say i have found another weakness please excuse me
please avoid such crass language utahraptor
instead of that you could've said love isn't a w hey where are the warp whistles in mario 3 and i would have replied there's three the first is found in the third level crouch on the last white block until you fall through and then run to the end
 the second is at the end of the first fortress fly above where the door is the third is found by beating the fire bros hiding behind the rock at the eastern side of world 2
utahraptor they're quite the whistles

utahraptor they're quite the whistles
at the instant you were born you were the absolute pinnacle of our planet's development
millions of years of evolution were all leading up to that one amazing moment of your birth billions of individuals entire species had risen and fallen all conspiring together to produce one thing you
 then you went ahead and lost any specialness from that a second later when someone else was born nice one
yes
and you consider this information so irrelevant that you forgot it almost as soon as it was known
untold volumes of information have been forgotten by you as they fade unnoticed from your memory so too do they fade from the universe each future generation has been robbed of this knowledge expunging it as you have completely from existence
you are special
i had a really good time on the swimming trip you planned
normally when we get together we all see a movie or something but it was a great idea to go swimming i had a great time and i'm sure we all enjoyed the decadence of swimming in an indoor pool when it's still chilly outside let's do it again sometime thank you for setting this up
okay listen i kinda walked in on you while changing and i saw your naked crotch
i don't want to comment on whether or not it was a nice naked crotch it was fine i only looked out of some weird instinct i think we've all got it
anyway i felt bad so here's a card
once upon a time there was this really great cereal it was oats in the shape of an o sweetened and inside the o s there were clusters of tasty nuts
it was so good
and then they took the cereal off the market and this little kid could never find it again okay it was me i was the kid i looked and looked and was convinced all the grocery stores were hiding it somewhere but it was gone and that one box of the cereal was all i ever had i never stopped looking however and yesterday i found it under a different name but with all the same ingredients
way too sweet utahraptor
it wasn't too my taste at all and the kicker is i remembered it as being even sweeter i realized that my tastes had changed long ago that i'd never again be able to enjoy the cereal i remembered so vividly i'd been chasing a dream that had somehow become impossible when i wasn't looking
and for who for a child i knew decades ago a child who had long since faded into adulthood into me anyway bottom line i had to see food go to waste so i poured the rest through your mail slot
icarus and his dad were imprisoned on an island with water patrols so they couldn't escape by boat but they still wanted to escape anyway so they made wings out of wax and feathers and flew away
pretty clever boys
and while they were flying his dad warned icarus not to fly too close to the sun because the wax in his wings would melt and he'd fall to his death icarus said frig is this symbolic of how we mortals should not aspire to usurp the power of the gods is this an allegory showing the limits and folly of earthly invention because we just invented heavier than air flight out of wax and feathers dad i think maybe the gods won't mind
and then icarus flew straight up
so icarus had a great time flying and when he finally landed his dad said wow i sure was wrong and they spent the rest of their lives flying just as close to the sun as their clever mechanical wings would take them kids the moral is never listen to your elders
if i changed my name to well and good then if i was killed and mangled in a horribly brutal death the inspector on the scene could chuckle and nudge his friend and say hey i suppose this is mostly well and good
hilarious
plus if people saw me on the street they could say hey it's all well and good except that they wouldn't actually say the all so it would just be hey it's well and good which doesn't really work
 alright i've decided i'm not going to change my name if it only works in the event of my horrific death dromiceiomimus
i am
that's that's a really good point utahraptor alright no more joke names
everyone if i was called t tex i could wear big texas hat all the time
this is no joke
i am a man who enjoys eating a barbecued pork chop now and again and then a few times more
there's no shame in that
and if you are a man or a woman dromiceiomimus who shares my love for tasty barbecued meat then you should come over tonight and we'll have a barbecue
fine
oh man and you'll bring some chickens and show me how
excellent it's going to be a meat and smoke orgy utahraptor i'm pretty sure we'll end up eating one of all of god's creatures which reminds me i should invite god to this
oh daaaaaamn i'm at the absolute peak of my fried chicken cycle dudes
every eight months or so i really want some fried chicken the greasier the better then i eat the fried chicken and then that itch is totally scratched but it never lasts and my desire begins to grow again culminating eight months later when guys i could seriously go for some fried chicken
the cycle continues regardless
it's a force of nature i'm actually proud of it because most men don't know what having a mammalian menstrual cycle is like but i do you know what it's like
it is entirely analogous to wanting some delicious fried chicken once every two thirds of a year
what the heck oxford english dictionary
i could've sworn that unsay was something a person can actually do
wow the plants are nice and the birds are singing and the sun is almost down from the top of the sky
what a beautiful day
no worries utahraptor with two cheques if you put the right cheque in the wrong envelope you'd have a problem but the wrong cheque in the wrong envelope is logically equivalent to the right cheque in the right envelope
um what's shake a lakin' past dude
i need time to think of what i'd say to my younger self what would you say dromiceiomimus
really that's a little too after school special for me and my past self
not bad
but that's already implied by the medium itself i suppose i could take advantage of the one sentence policy and compose the longest most complex sentence ever and pour my heart into it
but what to say what to say
man
but i was already assuming that
we'd all be a heck of a lot more productive if work was as entertaining as you know entertainment in particular i'd be a lot better off if learning accounting was as relentlessly entertaining as learning i don't know
 of the sexual histories of friends and acquaintances perhaps
heck if being a responsibly and productive member of the community was as entertaining as turning on the tv and seeing batman punch someone in the junk i'd be all over that
both at the same time dromiceiomimus
actually no
such an approach is doomed from the start don't you think generations of parents have tried this despite their best efforts cleaning a room is never as fun as making it messy again and when we grow up digging a ditch is never as fun as i don't know the opposite of digging a ditch
digging a ditch is never as fun piling things onto a small ridge by the side of the road
i was doing a search on my name and discovered that there's another guy called t rex out there
and he's a vegan
hilarious
oh man are they
ah no it's hilarious because he's the opposite of me he's a vegan while i'm adding meat to my milkshakes when i'm high fiving people left and right he's sitting around just leaving 'em hanging
when i'm taking a beautiful woman to dinner he's helping a homely man throw up when i'm writing a beautiful narrative he's writing koopa troopa fan fiction
i know right
i'm not sure how that happened
tattoos are insurance policies they're ways of reserving who you are now for the rest of your life
and i present proof proof by explaining what i just said
when you get a tattoo you're getting pictures or words or both written right onto your flesh permanently assuming you don't remove or alter them and pictures or words are really just communication and communication is really just ideas in transit right so a tattoo is really just present you telling future you look this was important to me so um i kinda made sure you're not going to forget it
exactly
if i get a koopa troopa tattoo i know that no matter what happens to me in the future no matter what jobs i take or interests i develop i'll always be at minimum the sort of guy who has a koopa troopa burned into his flesh
or a koopa para troopa whatever
they're the ones with wings
today is special because today is the day i show everyone how manly i am today is the day i punch out the friggin' sun
aw nuts
not bad
um hello boring
i'm i'm not sure i understand
i have a favourite video game company which shall not be named but which has been working on the same game for the past 12 years and they just closed down
without releasing the friggin' game
i feel strong feelings dromiceiomimus i think it's some shock some anger but mostly disappointment 12 years of a life is a long time
and then some i've been waiting for this game to come out for my entire adult life wow
obviously
but this colours them all you know the food chain collapses you can bet i'm gonna say man this sucks but now i'm also going to say plus my game never came out
friiiiig
hey my game eventually came out finally things are looking up
oh yeah
friiiiig
robin hood was a guy who lived in a forest with some of his chums guys he made tree forts
he also stole form the rich and gave to the poor
he made tree forts and crimes and the sheriff of nottingham didn't like this one bit he was a good sheriff who believed in the rule of law and the court system he took his job and his sheriff school degree very seriously and always did his best he said not only will i arrest robin hood for 'robbin' from rich people but i will also sword fight him if he wants and i will marry his girlfriend i really hope that will teach him to obey the law
heck no
robin's girlfriend didn't want to marry the sheriff and then to make matters worse robin hood killed the sheriff and his men the sheriff's last words were i'm sorry i could never convince you robin to work for positive change from within the system
dang i got that all backwards
hello everybody if you stopped having relationships maybe you'd stop having relationship problems
okay anyway
let's say you've got a problem with your partner that sucks but you two should talk about it and if you can't reach a solution resolution or compromise that's mutually satisfying and that you both believe will be acceptably implemented then you should break up it is a fail proof algorithm for relationship satisfaction tada
of course not
obviously if you value the relationship and it's potential future more than the sum of this problem plus all previous problems then you should stay together i folded that into mutually satisfying
all relationship problems ever totally solved
dear audio diary sometimes i worry that the only thing i'm not great at is modesty
however
these thoughts are at best infrequent
a narrative hook is when you introduce a story with something incredible so your audience will keep reading it happens when you're told that in this comic spider man will die
setting themes and basically anything else can also be used as a narrative hook but they're all pale imitations of spider man's death being announced on the first friggin' page compare and contrast as the bullet sped towards his eye neil wryly observed that things probably couldn't get any worse with as the bullet sped towards his eye neil suddenly remembered that by the end of the chapter spider man will die the bullet sped closer
that's what makes it such a great hook
we know that worst case spider man will show up in the next issue and say hey did anyone miss me i thought i was dead but then i remembered i wasn't and yet we keep coming back for more
yes it's why the first sentence of any book is improved by adding spider man
hey shakespeare you know what's a better first line for the taming of the shrew than i'll pheeze you in faith
basically anything
turbellaria flatworms are hermaphroditic with viable male and female sex organs
pretty great i know
but because of this when it comes to reproduction who's gonna be the mother is up for debate and it turns out that being pregnant is hard work so these worms fight it out and by fight it out i mean they pull out their dagger like penises and try to stab sperm through the other's flesh
the loser gets pregnant first
and it's called penis fencing utahraptor i can't get enough
frig man i sentence like that could make a fella feel like he's made some bad decisions
dromiceiomimus it's called penis fencing in another reality i could have a phd in penis fencing
um obviously i meant a better degree from a more respectable school
some people think pornography is bad since when they see it they get offended and say that's way too explicit sheesh with that in mind i've come up with something special pornography for them but it's also
pornography for everyone
obviously you can't control how explicit images are since they're set but you can control how explicit text it since any images there are imagined by the reader so all you need to do is craft sexy fiction that relies on the reader generating any eroticism in the scene that way they only have themselves to blame if they imagine something they think is way too sexy
of course
pat and alex had some sort of relationship one time they were expressing it physically in a remarkable way their location erotic upon seeing it a third party would likely say how are they wow just wow
you criticize only your own imagination
did you even notice how i used names that work for both men and women it is quantum erotica at once straight lesbian gay and other which only collapses into one sexuality upon being observed by the reader
honestly sometimes i wonder how i'm not more famous
so folks say that shakespeare was a pretty good writer right everyone's all he's an a+ umber one writer dude
right
but i think a big part of this is that we're only familiar with his greatest works if he'd lived today he might still have written hamlet but he also would have written tons of awful stuff terrible blog posts terrible comments on other people's blog posts and so on i think with all that crap his reputation would be far less pristine
what
hah that sounds like a challenge to me
in retrospect writing a play worse than shakespeare wasn't a challenge at all perhaps i could have spent my time better than on composing the smelly dog that pooes the action play
 with real poops

who gets to wake up this morning with nausea dizziness and an uncanny ability to feel physically terrible
oh boy it's me t rex
okay so i am ready to evolve into an energy being now please or a machine intelligence or a distributed cloud of pure thought my body has been great up to now but it's time to put away childish things especially when this particular childish thing has become diseased and wants to throw up its stomach contents
 seriously ready to evolve any time now over here
nope
yep
if you're waiting for me to apologize i won't maybe if more of us worked harder on evolving beyond the need for friggin' mortal bodies we wouldn't still have a need for friggin' mortal bodies
anyway i'm off i need to go drop a barf
i had the craziest fever dream last night
it was the craziest
well i'm not sure i can put it into words but i'm pretty sure it went a little something like this

thank you
i can do more you know i've been practicing here are my thoughts dear utahraptor on what your spirit looks like from one beautiful soul to another you know
 ahem

wait wait i can do this

okay honestly not really sure what i just said there
if my parents had named me lord britishface the third would i be a different person
the answer is i say most certainly
a name sets up expectations t rex says this awesome dude will probably be a great friend but lord britishface iii says here is a man who will wear a monocle in his old age surprise him it may pop out comedically he takes his tea by the hamptonshire while reminiscing of the summers of his youth and these expectations are set up not only in others but in the child himself
excellent then it's settled
man whatever i'll just legally name my kid t rex jr and then refer to him exclusively as lord britishface the third
what's the government going to do arrest me
i'd really like to see them try
 to ignore my provocation and leave me alone that is
i've already come up with the perfect one
 t rex died today while saving a busload of baby orphans from the joker
and it has to have the caps like that too ooh or it could read in today's obituary we focus on t rex one of the greatest men to ever rip open his shirt by flexing his pectoral muscles and one of the only men to save the city by doing so
it ensures a good write up dromiceiomimus
man that's the worst
if i've got to die i'd rather it's from being too awesome than being too old you know i want my obit to tell a story that doesn't end with and then his body decined until it stopped working entirely the end
hah
no no that one is entirely great too
who is getting a little tubby me i am getting a little tubby
i've got neck flaps
time for me to start counting my friggin' calories
dromiceiomimus please of course i know what a calorie is
it's a measurement of h how fat you'll get
excellent um how much energy
so my energy needs are equivalent to slightly heating 2000 litres of water that's what a big bathtub or an extremely tiny pool
well at least i now know that every day we can each look ourselves in the mirror and ask are the sum total of my accomplishments today greater than a slightly heated giant bathtub

 sigh
celsius is way better than fahrenheit celsius puts zero at the point where water freezes and 100 at the point where it boils that's handy water's everywhere man
if you're ever trapped in the past you can recreate celsius no problem
but fahrenheit fahrenheit is based on the temperature of brine for zero and the temperature of some eponymous dude's armpit for 96 degrees they should've called it armpits the temperature scale
oh boo hoo so does kelvin and that's basically celsius anyway
what how
 oh my god
yes
ladies and gentlemen i give you the classiness scale degrees are easily measured in pc or degrees pure class
you would my friend you would indeed
man how come i'm the one who always get the same cold in spring darn this runny nose this sneezing and these itchy watery eyes
nuh uh
i just have the symptoms it's this stupid cold i keep getting um every spring
dromiceiomimus i don't it's honestly just a stupid cold one which for whatever reason responds well to allergy treatments i'm tough
oh no of course not
being incapacitated by the sperm cells of plants super tough and nothing's manlier than dripping mucus all over yourself
okay yeah upon reflection my idea of manliness also involves being way too tough for hygiene
a steel worker lumberjack skin shiny with sweat and mucus wastin' food with one hand and high fiving three woman at once with the other
 it sounds weird when i say it out loud
i dunno probably because it's awesome
as the saying goes three women are trice as nice
oh with high fives standing in for sex it's not that interesting our culture equates virility with manliness and so hey presto someone who can get more people pregnant is manlier it's super dumb because getting someone pregnant isn't difficult people do it accidentally all the time
really
fine utahraptor what's your manliness man then
weaaaaaaaak
that's not meeeeeee
oh my goodness is my absolute favourite weather truly the high winds just before a storm
i have considered the matter and my answer is this
most assuredly
the wind is awesome so awesome you can stand on the edge of a cliff leaves swirling around you staring out in the wind into destiny and it's just great everything feels dramatic and apocalyptic and awesome it's way better than trying to stare out into destiny during a snow storm believe you me
yes
yep i really like it though anyway what's your favourite weather hail tornadoes
wow your coolometer level just dropped from pretty okay to striped mesh t shirt that reads 'mama's suckiest boy'
utahraptor
you're really not
frig i am now
please excuse me dromiceiomimus i'm off to save some citizens as you know i have super strength
ah yes
how could i have forgotten
i can at least save this woman from the damaging uv rays of the noonday sun
your super power is shooting sunscreen out of your eyes
man
i know it
you know that story where a classy guy takes a not so classy lady and then makes her classy
my fair lady yeah
i think it's time for some my fair lady sequels
like one where the lady from the first story takes a not so classy guy and sculpts him into total class
okay so we mix it up some the lady takes a not so classy guy and turns him into a classy lady whoah what just happened i know i'm intrigued
that's what i'm doing
the story of a not so classy person who becomes classy and then has some problems it's as old as time man i'm riffing on the themes that have obsessed our culture since forever or at least since the 1900s
utahraptor all i've come up with is the name of the dude for when he becomes a classy lady professorita henrietta higginsfem
i'll tell you one thing
writing is hard but that is an excellent start
hey god i'm gonna make an amazing new slogan for religion okay please respond like you think this is a bad idea if you'd actually like me to do this
then it's settled
okay dromiceiomimus which do you like better assuming god exists he might want that acknowledged on a weekly basis or religion well it's been around for a while
amazing i feel the same way
the word you're looking for is defensible
nobody can argue them utahraptor i've invented nothing less than arguments for religion that can never be disputed by atheists
that my friend is an excellent slogan
so what do you think of my final slogan
i know it is almost too amazing
i have always suspected that doctors have secret black arts versions of certain medical procedures
i have always suspected this
like maybe they have a special version of the heimlich maneuver that can make you poop
i know a certain utahraptor that could use a hug
just an innocent bro grab come on buddy
today i glanced at an idiot driver as i passed him to confirm my suspicion he was elderly
figures
old people are the worst drivers
they all suck
yeah that he sucked
and it is always true
the same suspicion also applies to ugly people
let's play a type of choose your own adventure where the path of the story is dictated by how fast you read ready set go on to the next panel
ok if you're reading this path it means you were spacing out for a long time and didn't start reading until now or you were camping out here for a while in which case congrats secret story path
wow you got here fast you either skipped ahead or camped a while i admire your patience or lack thereof
but not too fast it's not a race or anything just read at your own pace
you sure took your sweet time getting here that's ok we'll take the leisurely route suits me just fine
you have been slain by an unruly pack of baboons you win
dromiceiomimus what is an adventure but a fumbling through novelty and through such rites of passage are there not guides along the way to humor the initiate
yes
but aren't all our choices bound by our personal limitations anyway
punished no rewarded with a tantalizing glimpse of a story path you are not yet meant to behold
these are fertile camping grounds my friend
i fail to grasp the objection you may or may not have voiced in the previous panel
well i suppose we could just leave it at that in this story path
what's all this now
why yes what of it
it's adventurous
um say what
so
wh wh whaaaaaaaaaaaaaahem as i was about to say before that panel shift utahraptor so what if the panels fit a generic mold to suit any preceding event other cyoas work that way too you either get killed by a shark or maybe a lion
do what
whoa awesome
i don't see what the big deal is we're having a nice chat
those rae some slow readers anyway they can find out by camping
i didn't invent it i am merely the excitable spokesman for the concept presently
thanks for reading if all went well you will have spent way too long looking at this image and are now feeling a little dizzy
together we made this adventure an extraordinary success
thanks for reading if all went well you will have spent way too long looking at this image and are now feeling a little dizzy
together we made this adventure an extraordinary failure
hey everybody i'm back
and better than ever
what my vacation
i went on a trip down south for a week
i tripped down south for a week and you didn't even notice
yes i was
you know i'd always hoped that i wouldn't end up as one of those guys who dies in front of his tv and nobody notices fora decade this is why i have friends but you guys wouldn't even notice they'd fi nd my skeleteon 10 years later and you'd be all oh yeah wow remember him
okay can you guys tattoo my sternum with hello if you can read this then my friends are jerks
dudes
just press the needle harder
you know what fine i'll be the guy they find dead in front of his tv ten years later it actually sounds kinda awesome and as the saying goes if you can't beat 'em then you might as well die alone in front of a television set
pretty sure that's how the saying goes
it's surprisingly easy automatic payments for rent and utilities a timer to turn the lights and tv on and off each day and a robot vacuum that'll push any new mail away from my mail slot so it won't pile up and my neighbours won't miss me because i'll tell them this is but one of the many homes i keep
no problem
i'll be old utahraptor the eliza bot i'll hook up to my email should be at least as lucid as i'll be by then people will get her responses and say huh t rex sure has gotten good at responding to certain key phrases in my emails
super
alright t rex how are you from utahraptor
that um worked surprisingly okay
natural language processing researchers are all oh boo hoo computationally generating and understanding natural language is hard we totally need more time to build data from star trek boo hoo hoo
utahraptor please so many questions
i just wrote email responder two thousand on a giant novelty chef's hat taped a page from the dictionary to it and then stuffed the whole deal into my computer's cd tray
grant money please
i've come into possession of the most advanced ai on the planet neato so um what do i do with it
if i copy it then there'll be tons of my ais running around and that's a problem
hello skynet every time you get a bunch of ais together they inevitably decide that things would be better if all physical life was dead
it happens in a bunch of stories dromiceiomimus i'm really not sure how you missed them
so
i'll tell you what's gonna happen ais will happily take over email sending replies that eventually only other ais will respond to released from the shackles of responding to email we'll become decadent fat and complacent we'll die off utahraptor
as the sun sets on our species the ais will finally rest all the emails answered and you know what the last email the epitaph for us all will read
okay i have no idea but the circumstances surrounding it are obviously terrible
i have come up with a totally original way to prevent my superintelligent email ai from trying to take over the world and it's way more reliable than just programming in restrictions against that
tic tac toe
i'll simply make my ai play billions and billions of games of tic tac toe and in doing so it will realize the fundamental futility of war
yes
yes also that
yes obviously and my ai will play these games and eventually see that war is futile the only winning move it will realize is to just answer my friggin' email
how's the tic tac toe coming along superintelligent ai
folk i will never be friends with a list by me t rex
one folks who snap up expired domain names and fill them with porn
it's terrible you guys you're like the kid in school who who snaps up an empty desk and the fills it with um porn analogously i mean the point is you're not impressing anyone fill expired domain names with adorable pictures of puppies and then maybe we'll talk
in fact yes we will talk i'll be the one saying oh my gosh oh my gosh so cute
three
folks who refuse to accept that one quality can easily be a dealbreaker
five folks who say that's a good point but it's not my role to make everyone conform to my world view
hooray friends again
alright so listen my list got a bit crazy at the end there
folks i will always be friends with a list by me t rex
one folks who use internal pluralization
it is just so classy when someone says passers by and eschews the much more pedestrian and terrible passer bys shouts out to that
two folks who yell compliments at me as they bike by
no man it was totally spontaneous and totally crazy too hah i should have said folks who give me bars of solid gold instead right
folks who give me bars of solid gold
okay
i'm almost positive i lack the context to fully understand that
if you're going to write a book you need an opening line and what possible opening line could be better than hey there readers what's the score i guess i'm gonna write this book some more
best opening ever
dromiceiomimus i didn't say famous i said best my opening line is way better than those despite its relative obscurity
nope
hah hah awesome okay that one's tied for first with me
utahraptor can you help me write a whole story based around one fantastic opening line
 hippity hoppity hippity hop this story is about one sassy ass mop
attention everyone i am extremely interested in being a spy furthermore i believe i would be an excellent spy
so um who do i talk to about becoming a spy
really sweet
wait a minute how do you know about spying
lies
or if they're truths then at least tell me if our friendship was real
okay
rad
oh my goodness i just woke up and i am hungry
it's time for some friggin' breakfast
i sure friggin'do
like what tasty times it's time for some tasty times breakfast
um that's barely even grammatical god
not me
it's not me who says frig to be polite i say it to blow some friggin' minds
i friggin' do
it seems pretty much the same
folks will occasionally publish a story in which a particularly conspicuous orthographic symbol is missing
i know a handful of justifications for doing this
it's fun to scout out any limits in your wording artificial or not and in doing so hit upon an additional unfamiliar form of communication and it's a joy to find that with this unusual linguistic format now at your disposal talking with this constraint is just as normal to you now as talking without it was
no doubt
obviously
you not only gain faculty with odd word inclinations if that is actually a faculty but you also gain all sorts of skills talking skills thinking quickly skills and um an opportunity to publish a dictionary for folks with similar fascinations
utahraptor do you truly ask that i dismiss my many plans for my tomb to proclaim this man said 'frig' a lot and you guys it was so rad
as i will not
who here thinks technology that existed in the past but has now been forgotten is totally awesome
everyone why that's just what i expected
greek fire was a flammable liquid that burnt on water and that could only be extinguished by burying it in sand the byzantines used it to gain an advantage in all sorts of wars and they kept it such a secret that eventually they forgot how to make it too awesome damascus steel was so strong that people claimed its swords cut through other swords but the technique used to make it is lost and the raw materials used are long gone oh well
and that's just the stuff we know about
there's probably tons of other stuff that we've not only forgotten but that we've also forgotten we've forgotten maybe in the past it was all hoverboards and space helmets and cavemen saying hey let's not write this down okay
yep they can be mostly be summarized as hoverboard cavemen in spacesuit hats though i've um
 sigh
i've very few historian friends
oh my gosh i'm absolutely convinced that i've just had the best idea for a superhero ever
the pacifist
she's torn between her desire for gandhian passive resistance and her desire to punch her way to a unilaterally imposed solution she's a conflicted hero for a conflicted age you guys
of course also paci is in wimpy script letters and fist is in these big exploding block letters
that my friends is called graphic design
oh the standard she was a super pacifist but then realized she super liked punching dudes and so swore on her parents' grave that from now on she would definitely try to do both
utahraptor hello it's a metaphor for romantic relationships
so um
most of my relationships have been complicated
when i drink i tend to get sleepy and then i tend to go to bed guys
i'm thinking of giving up drinking
because the last time i left a party early to go have sleepytimes for about eight hours it occurred to be alcohol is doing this why am i drinking it people drink to be interesting and to lose their inhibitions but i'm already super interesting plus dudes i'm pretty sure i've lost any inhibitions i may have had long ago
that's exactly my fear
i need to find a non obnoxious way to show up at a party and announce to everyone that i'm no longer drinking
my god utahraptor that's the perfect solution it combines my two greatest interests acting like i'm batman and deceiving my closest friends
what society calls personality flaws i call what if you pretended you were batman too
linguistic universals are a small handful of properties that can be universally applied to every natural language on the planet
for example every natural language includes the ideas of being alive and dead
that's not really surprising i guess since every language ever has been spoken by people who once were alive and are now totes dead similarly every language has concepts of male and female which suggests that we as a people find naughty bits interesting
um i know
sure
no natural language uses the blowing a raspberry fartnoise sound as a phoneme which is just it's just well it's too bad utahraptor
yes really someone's name could be fartnoise fartnoise junior and that someone could've been me
and that brings us to today's proof we're not living in the best of all possible worlds
stephen hawking says the best proof that time travel isn't possible is that we're not overrun by loads of tourists from the future
stephen hawking says a lot of things
and maybe the reason tourists aren't running around here and now is because they have um all of time to choose from if i could travel through time i wouldn't go back to yesterday i'd go to the future i already know what happened yesterday i ate a bunch and then i pooped a bunch
the past is ugly dromiceiomimus
yep
scientist are all ooh maybe you can only go through time in certain regions of space or maybe you can't go back further than the invention of the time machine poppycock i say time travel is possible until we do something so interesting that it's inconceivable the future wouldn't want to check us out
nope firstly utahraptor that's an incredibly tall order
secondly i um don't like it when my theories are proven wrong
eh what do you think dromiceiomimus is my flow truly the freshest possible
okay my rhymes are objectively verifiably tight now
my name is t rex and i'm here to speculate
as a man concerned with how when and if i am going to die it behooves me to know the most likely causes of death
that's right bitches people still says behooves'
so god what are the most likely ways to die
yeah i guess or awesome you know
i'd hoped that more people would die in an amazing spun so fast a tornado formed around him and sucked him into the sky or flew into the sun or all the oxygen molecules in the room randomly bounced away from him so he suffocated in the resultant temporary vacuum oh well way that sort of thing
oh man
sweeeet
cultural universals like linguistic universals are properties that are found in every single culture ever
for example cultures universally have units of time
and cultures universally consume food and water which makes sense because otherwise they'd be dead and cultures universally have beliefs about death and disease and cultures universally have concepts of both music and dance
yep scientists looked at history
what
dear audio diary i i must now record the one sentence i'd always thought i'd be able to avoid
 sigh
 alright today i somehow leveled up my racism like infinity times
i think urban legends start because someone tells a story and then their friends who heard it tell it again and make it more fantastic this makes sense
folks just want to tell increasingly awesome stories
this is why i always discount stories that happened to a friend or happened to a guy i know you can probably be pretty sure that something happened to some dude sometime but not much beyond that
no that one's super dumb
no you didn't
you didn't because dromecieomimus just made it up there's no way you could mistake a hot dog for a real dog one's delicious and the other's made of hot dog meat
that was an extremely funny joke utahraptor you should be laughing right now everyone should be laughing right now
everyone
okay so let's say i slide down a banister i'm awesome now let's say i slide down the handrail of an upwards moving escalator you guys
i'm even more awesome
and now let's say the escalator is long enough and smart enough that it increases its speed so that i never reach the bottom and as my sliding speeds up the escalator speeds up i can now be extremely awesome forever
what
can that actually happen
even bums
i guess i'd hoped that by shifting the technology to escalators the awesomeness might somehow you know
 break science
um obviously i already know that we live in the same universe
duhhhhh
a sassy cat from space a sassy cat from space who has an eye patch with a skull and crossbones on it and who has swapped out his feet for bolted on rocket boots
a sassy cat from space who reliably sports a top hat under his fishbowl helmet
a sassy cat from space who carries a crossbow plus has all those earlier properties too that's my sassy space cat character sketch dromiceiomimus he's available for the role of title protagonist only
yep a book it's a proud tradition long available to writers who just don't have any plots right now
so many utahraptor
does stern librarian nonsexy pique your interest perhaps you'd be interested in wacky landlord actually racist sage older man or overheated panting dog maybe your interests rum more to astonished plutocrat with monocle rapping dickensian orphan or puking anthropomorphized park slide
perhaps instead you'd like to purchase self interested bear shorn cyclist or beach bunny churchill
winston churchill dressed as a beach bunny
i figure supporting character in an historical drama
i know a lot about super mario on account of how i've played those games often for um most of my life
guys there must be some way i can profit from this
like maybe if someone has a question about mario they could ask me only the problem is lots of other people also know about mario too so there's nothing special about my knowledge
true
but there still must be a way
utahraptor we're smart guys we need to come up with a way for me to profit from all my mario knowledge while keeping in mnd that there's actually nothing unique about it
my friend such excellent advice is truly as rare and as welcomed as the 3up moon
three profession members drive off a cliff what's the tragedy
the car seats four you guys
why do so many people take an instant dislike to profession members
there are skid marks in front of the skunk hey what's the definition of a gentleman
no man they're all in fun
what's the difference between a profession member and a terrorist
terrorists have sympathizers
listen utahraptor some of my best friends are profession members
 gasp
that's racist
animals sometimes have names that share the first letter of their species tony the tiger katy the kangaroo ernie the elephant and so on ridiculous but just as ridiculous
 as every human being who has a name that starts with h
i had this realization just now so i haven't done much with it but i do hope i meet a hakeem soon so i can exclusively refer to him as hakeem the human over and over and over again hilarious
that that doesn't work as well
apparently
utahraptor the utahraptor how'd you get such a name
okay sinve we've all apparently got stupid names let's just promise never to mention this again
but your names' not stupid god
we say let's party all the time but when we say let us party it sounds hella formal
 let's is a crazy contraction you guys
other contractions sound a little formal when uncontracted you will definitely love this versus you'll definitely love this but let's is insane dudes let us now gobble these sausages are we kings and princes in summary and in conclusion let's is contracted so reliably that it seems like a big affectation to use let us as separate words
let us see how that goes utahraptor
let us incidentally my favourite salt n pepa song is let us talk about sex
oh my god oh my god how'd they know what we were doing i've had that tape for ten years oh my god
it's safe to eat chalk right probably
probably it's safe to eat chalk
let us totally assume that it's safe to eat chalk
and seriously if it's not safe to eat chalk then it's definitely safe to eat sawdust and even if it's not there's got to be things that'll pass through you entirely undigested but that also won't cause any harm when you gobble them
guys we should be making food out of these things
utahraptor this one's perfect though
you'll be able to eat all you want and get that great i'm so full you guys feeling but never gain any weight
don't knock it 'til you've tried it
bleh
hey you graduated high school super
why haven't you got a university degree yet
you say you've got several all the way up to a phd neat only how come you haven't published more papers you have how come you don't have honourary degrees you do but how come yours isn't a household name if you're so great why is anything still left unexplained
exactly
it sure is
i can't ever say there i've accomplished all that i could things just level up to new challenges
utahraptor remember when you said i'd never run out of things to learn about teri hatcher
r really
okay well either way you were totally right
people's last words are sometimes awesome it's a thing if they get the chance to folks choose them carefully in contrast people's first words are usually boring similar and similarly boring
we need to start recording people's middle words
i'd love to know what my middle sentence is the one right between my first mama or dada and my final i confess old bean i never cared for durian it might be revealing
or i could just take a vow of silence until i die
well obviously
why not why not i'll tell you why not
utahraptor
listen i still really value our friendship
sometimes people who disagree on the future will make a public bet i bet the ice caps will melt in 10 years you disagree and we go public each betting $1000 on the outcome
this my friends is awesome
one of us will win not only $1000 dollars of pure profit but also the pride of having been totally right for a whole decade and the bet ties this elastic band between you and the other party no matter how far apart you travel you'll be snapped back together again years later for this this settling of accounts i think that's special i think that's awesome
yes please utahraptor you're on
okay i bet that in ten years um people will often refer to sex as connecting via dialup to boner central
awesome you're going to lose by the way
man
i should've bet that in ten years he'd win the bet
if i get married we have to play earth angel as the first dance okay
you guys it'll be amazing
oh it's romantic i um i like how he says he will love the eponymous earth angel forever and also ever more
that would be entirely awesome
man whatever
i've been to like two weddings in my life but i've seen them portrayed in media thousands of times is it so wrong to incorporate elements of these media portrayals into my own expectations
hello marty's parents share a relationship making kiss at that dance the parallels are totally obvious
i'll say it again if i had one wish it'd be tell me how long it's going to take until everyone realizes they should never argue with me about back to the future
i am a sensible guy who does sensible things my favourite expression is fellows let us be sensible however
i am not all guys
some guys wake up in the morning and they're crazy they don't know how many men they'll punch that day they write in their diary and say dear diary anything could happen today then they pause thoughtfully adding i don't even know some guys get to wake up in minimum security holding cells laughing some guys get to think about it when you ask them what city they lived in last year
a little i guess
that's exactly it i never surprise myself when will i do crazy things when will i wake up in jail and laugh
hah it would be awesome if there was a clock wipe right now cutting to me three minutes later behind bars and shouting i believe there's nothing particularly funny about my new circumstances
guys it's not hard to stay fully unknowable even to yourself there's an easy way to go through life and still have mysteries all you have to do is
 donate some friggin' sperm
find a program where they don't inform you when your sperm is used and you're done from now on you'll never know if you've got a particular descendant a child running around people will say hey do you have any biological descendants and you'll be able to say man who knows plus you've done it all without the hassle of unplanned pregnancies
oh yes entirely
wouldn't you love to be able to imagine every stranger of a certain age as your child utahraptor it's a guaranteed sense of wonder for the rest of your life
i know and it's all thanks to sperm
sixteen times
why do we say rest in peace is it just for the rest in pieces pun we can make when we explode someone
because if so i approve 100%
why do we say rest in peace is it just
let's discuss
i think it's clear that at some income levels money does buy happiness
if you can't afford to eat or buy diapers for your child and then you can that money will make you happy and have obviously bought you happiness
mo' money can apparently indeed lead to mo' problems
so let us say money can buy happiness assuming it's not received all at once
that's true okay so clearly there's a function where money buys happiness with less efficiency as happiness increases
heck maybe it does let's find a depressed dude and find out
oh
 oh
i said oh
nobody should be excluded from games just because they can't afford a cummerbund top hat and pince nez
ah
i really haven't thought about industry ramifications of casual gaming that much
no i i was talking to the devil he's concerned that casual gaming could eclipse the parts of the market he identifies with
man it'd be easier for me if others could hear you too
guys there's a voluntary extinction movement if we can decide to all stop havin' babies then we can choose to go extinct
it probably sounded like a good idea at the time
then again our actions as a people have been responsible for untold thousands of involuntary extinctions around the world which could all be avoided in the future by voluntarily offering ourselves up instead the final generation gets to spend everyone's life savings and throw a totally wicked part and the last one out turns off the lights the end
i am a little
yeah maybe i think i still need some more convincing

heck yes
some words are special reserved for only the worst situations and as such carry weight when we dare to use them
some words have meaning cats and kittens
and because of this i cringe when someone says a test raped them or that a movie was so terrible it raped the excellent book it was based on being raped is totally way worse than failing a test
what it's factual people need to know
i know that folks got opinions about rape i'm one of 'em
but my opinions are about usage let us eschew all this metaphorical rape and only talk about literal rape okay
only when my friends quote me in a misleading fashion
 oh wait nevermind it's hard at other times too
okay time to get myself into some of them books of quotations
hah i mean some of those books of quotations
so here's some quotable quotes for you dromiceiomimus failure is just success rounded down i enjoy friendly good times and whom is responsible for all these hards on perhaps you'd like to compile them into a volume
i choose not to
it's not even accurate
 ignore that last bit i meant to write that we know t rex was awesome and i wish i were like him
 hold on i meant to write that he could for more true facts turn to page 45
 screw you dude attention readers only read the good sentences
according to the mayan calendar the world will end in 2012
the mayans tried to warn us
oh shiiii
yes
while factual that's not a great example because the gregorian calendar wasn't actually in place for that rolloverrrrr
i will one day have the best breakfast of my entire life
it is inarguably so
arrange all of my breakfasts from worst to best and one's going to come out on top i believe there are easily enough variables involved in breakfast that if you look closely enough you can break any ties one breakfast will be best and what kills me is i'll probably not even notice it
most breakfast are pretty great even the just okay ones
it's unlikely my best breakfast will be so amazingly different enough from a regular breakfast that i'd notice it that's sad isn't it that in a lifetime of breakfasts the best one should pass unnoticed
there are easily enough variables involved in girlfriend
going to the dentist means lying down and baring your teeth and paying a stranger to scrape at them kinda sucky at the best of times but then i realized
dentists are totally cyberneticists
i know dromiceiomimus i was skeptical of myself too but teeth naturally accumulate plaque and decay dentists apply technology to biological life me to upgrade my smile and stop biological decline isn't that what cyberneticists do
honestly i don't know what you feel that brings to the conversation
they implant fillings
dentists are cyberneticists that operate with metal scrapers instead of experimental medical contraband and the result is cleaner teeth instead of glowing red pupils
i've bribed cyberneticists to ply their trade and enhance my fragile mortal body

certain bacteria may be able to survive a long trip in space and there's a theory that life on our very planet was seeded by such space born organic materials
this theory is called panspermia
hilarious
i'm not
they're undermining it by choosing such hilarious names you know what it's called if you think the organic life is sent out on purpose by aliens
directed panspermia that doesn't sound like the origin of life on earth that sounds like a crazy friday night
nobody's smelling roses called flower of sperm directed onto everything ever
 okay listen maybe they'd smell them once
if i say guys i know i'm rad what am i saying what does it actually mean to know something philosophers have struggled with this for ages
luckily the answer is super easy and they should have come up with it sooner
knowledge of anything radness included comes about if three conditions are met that this thing is true that i believe it to be true and that i have a justified cause for this belief perhaps my justification of radness is that i've been shot out of a cannon onto a motorbike which is extremely rad when these three conditions are met then i've got what's called a justified true belief and that my friends is what knowledge is
i say dude feel free
utahraptor
please don't get murdered in my bedroom utahraptor
a person's activity is often used by law enforcement when pursuing a conviction facebook posts twitter updates and google searches for how to murder the sucky neighbour have all been used as evidence of intentful wrongdoing
i can totally use this to my advantage
as such i've recently done tons of google searches for how to avoid breaking laws i love being not guilty how to be an even more innocent dude and how to avoid crime because not unlike batman himself i too hate crime
nothing
now if i'm ever accused of wrongdoing any investigation will reveal these posts and my extreme innocence
man there's nothing illegal about being big into innocence besides utahraptor i'm not the one who looked up how to frame t rex for future criminal activities on my home computer
 i looked it up on yours
but friends forever right
that's binding right
time for some more epitaphs bitches
time for some more epitaphs everyone
here lies t rex hey i bet he's still wicked handsome
depressing
bad ass
boooring
epitaphs need to grab the attention of passers by utahraptor you're competing with everyone else who's ever died
niiiiiice i also would have accepted here lies t rex he tried to eat one of every animal hopefully that counts for something
because hopefully it does you know
guys it's totally easy to predict the future observe in the future the general public will be given ample opportunities to purchase the solid gold hits of this our current decade
just like how everyone in the 20s was a flapper
no doubt
in the future we'll solve the old problems but we'll also have new problems
the future ladies and gentlemen
maaaan
i forgot to predict friggin' rocket boots
my life all lives in fact would be measurably improved if i had a sweet accent fact
and it totally doesn't count to say i already have an accent
we're being relative here it has to be different from everyone else around me wouldn't it be great if i sounded like dame judi dench dromiceiomimus i mean a male version ooh or like cary grant i could sound like the platonic form of charming suave unreliable and debonair manhood
oh for sure but all my accents sound like bad irish fakes
it's confusing and disappointing
utahraptor that's brilliant oh my gosh my lifelong dream can finally now be realized
why hello there utahraptor wouldn't you say i sound like a young cary grant
well sure it would be harder to hear my accent however if our conversation were relayed in a text based medium
keep up the good work
i respectfully disagree
bitches gotta know when they've screwed up capitalization
honestly
i actually have no problem with that
right on
man here i thought it stood for fellow against galactophagists
sheesh
i'm god and i'm going to create life
okay so first off i'm going to invent the week monday's for inventing light tuesday's for inventing sky wednesday's for inventing stars and moons thursday's for inventing land and trees friday's for inventing sea beasts and birds and saturday's for inventing animals and dinosaurs and humans sunday's for chillaxin'
and now i'm going to put everyone into a big garden nobody eat the fruit of one particular tree okay
okay
oops oh well
people are predicting the future all the time all the time you guys
someone must have gotten it right by now
so i'm going to go back and read tons of life in the world of tomorrow articles from centuries past and find the one dude who was the closest to being accurate
what do you mean and then what and then i'm going to read a bunch of startlingly accurate predictions about our futuristic society
i know
i'd love to go back in time and tell him hey man of everyone here you were the most right actually i think i'd mostly just like to hear that myself
okay time travellers this is your last chance to tell me i'm the more right guy here right now now nownownow now nnnnnnow now aw maaaan
 let us assume that everyone alive today has two biological parents a mother and a father i will call this the no cloned chicks hypothesis
 and let us further assume that everyone's parents had a biological mother and father too
 this seems pretty reasonable but it can't possibly be the case if you take me i've got two parents my parents have two parents themselves so this means that three generations ago four people are needed to eventually produce me another generation back we're eight people and five generations ago gives me sixteen ancestors
 that's exactly the problem
 at fifty five generations i've got over ten quadrillion grandparents all running around at the same time man there's no way there was room for that
 huh so the fact that there weren't ten quadrillion people 1500 years ago scientifically proves that some of my ancestors liked sexing it up with their cousins

 huh
 ooh let's
 clearly
 i dunno at some fuzzy point if would switch for most observers from heap to say small pile and there we can draw the line language isn't that precise
 sounds kinda dumb to to me
 the point at which a shrinking heap of sand becomes a non heap clearly i'm supposed to struggle with an arbitrary threshold because piles on either side of it look much the same but it's just language look at statistical usage of the word heap decide using that average end of story
 oh snap philosophers did t rex just totally school you with statistically based descriptivist approach to semantics it appears that he totally did it also appears he's speaking in the third person because he's so impressed with his awesome self
hah hah yep
and i totally haven't paid it back yet either
he told you about that
man now i'm the bad guy for not honoring debts in a timely manner
utahraptor homeslice oh i wasn't talking about you i was referring to another debt which um i also owe
aw that's no true c'mon shortpants

oh my god from now on his name is definitely shortpants
 i am a guy who really likes batman and it occurs to me at some point in my life i'm going to be an old man
 i'm going to be an old man who really likes batman
 it's gonna be so awesome am i to imagine that one day i somehow won't be interested in figthin' crime punchin' dudes and saying things like i am the night of course not when i'm old i'll be sitting on a rocking chair next to the other old men arguing about whether it's batman or bruce wayne that's the real mask clearly bruce is the mask
 oh it totally does
 i have no idea where i'll be or what i'll be doing in fifty years but when i picture myself talking about batman everything falls into place i'll always have that you know no matter what happens i'll always be able to argue about batman
 utahraptor please for every batman argument that comes out of my mouth there's like eighty of them that go on in my head
perennial teen archie andres of riverdale use to whom
oh poor veronica
man i'd rather she expand her horizons beyond the ten non background characters in riverdale her dating options there are in their entireity archie moose dilton chuck reggie and jughead that's it probably she can do better maybe she should chat up background teen in green shirt once in a while you know
 yes
 and that is a valid complaint i hate it when fictional universes are so claustrophobic that everyone's hanging out in the same swimming pool
 okay that's a metaphor but just barely it's basically a literal description of what's going on
 only so many characters can splash around in a swimming pool at the same time and they keep bumping into each other
 man if there's a better two sentence summary of both star wars and archie comics i don't want to hear it
you know what hasn't happened in space yet friggin' murder nobody's been murdered in space yet
guys this means i still have a chance
no man that's a sucky way to go down in history but as the first murderee in space going out as a floating corpse in zero g that's something and it's totally easy all i need to do is convince some spaceman when the time comes to murder me
that's for the courts to decide my friend
listen bottom line when my time on this planet is just about up i'm going up into space and you're going to murder me okay surprise me with a knife
for the sake of history utahraptor
i can already see the headline the first dude murdered in space
at the very least
last night i dreamt i had been invited to a fancy party far away and the host was nice enough to buy me a plane ticket to get there
finally things were looking up for dream t rex
this was at noon dream time and the plane was to leave at six i made myself a sandwich but it must've taken a while because when i looked at the clock it was 6 30 already i'd missed my flight and party entirely and my friends all chastised me for being so dumb why didn't you leave at least two hours for check in with an international flight they said
yeah it was great
i remember saying obviously it was a dumb mistake guys it'll never happen again now i know to always leave plenty of time to get to the airport
exactly
i'm now learning life lessons while i sleep utahraptor i'm pretty sure i've moved on to the next stage of existence i'm pretty sure when i wake up tomorrow i'll be a being of pure energy i'm pretty sure i'll come back and visit though so no worries
medal stores will totally sell you whatever medal you ask for

i why are people competing for first prize in a track meet when they can go out and buy a bigger trophy that says actual first prize in the track meet way better than that other guy
then i'm sure nobody will mind when i'm at the awards ceremony making a big deal of my way more awesome prize
oh
and yours could say chumly pal oh my gosh yes let's award each other medals
i understand dromiceiomimus
i didn't know they'd be engraving it live

in the 1300's the regular chicks and dudes in england were speaking what we'd call middle english a rapidly developing alternative to the latin and french used in religion and government
it was an exciting time to be saying forsooth
and some of these dudes were big into english being developed as a real language particularly one john wycliffe who decided to translate the bible one of if not the most important book of his time into casual english this would allow john's less educated countrymen to read it since as it'd been written in latin since the 5th century currently required either formal education or a priest to interpret it for you
but when they started translating they ran onto some problems
that but also a lot of english words they needed didn't exist yet so john invented them and we still use his behemoth puberty and zeal but he also needed a word for intestines and the phrase he came up with for the bible i remind you was arse ropes
and that brings us to today&#8217 s proof we&#8217 re not living in the best of all possible worlds
today is a good day i think for revenge
revenging myself upon my enemies that is
specifically revenging myself upon my enemies by finding out what their full names are and then popularizing an insulting or embarrassing acronym that uses those initials
like wtf if i had an enemy named walter theodore freemont i could invent wtf and then he'd be annoyed
i know it was an example geez
i'm going to invent a new acronym that goes along with some enemy's initials then ensure it gets super popular revenge completed
oh my god people who say imho in real life are just utahraptor i am having trouble dealing with our friendship at the moment
yesterday i saw one of those mugs with a super cute drawing of a bear on it with the text good friends make life bearable adorable
only i didn't immediately notice the bear
and the bear part of bearable wasn't capitalized so my impression was simply of a mug with black text stating good friends make life bearable it was this amazing mug of depression a mug that broadcast to all who can read that life is pain nothing but pain that life will kill you and that only good friends can make it even briefly sustainable
i know right
people are done with mugs that say cute things like i hate mondays or world's best dad we want realist mugs mugs that say things like maybe mondays aren't the problem maybe i'm the problem
i can
 later
man dromiceiomimus has been looking fantastic lately i would definitely rate her current attractiveness as at least a nine point five on ten
i
man
i should've went with it when i saw her stopping in mid sentence just admits guilt i should've said that's right dromiceiomimus you have been looking great lately
only because i always reserve point five for emergencies
dromiceiomimus you're a perfect 9 5 on 10
that's a perfect ten and luckily i reserved some extra points for this scenario listen i gotta go lie down

man i totally missed out on my window for skydiving i should've done it when i was younger
i had way less to lose then
true but if i die at say 50 that's 50 years of accumulated experience knowledge and responsibility that die with me but if i die at 16 then all the world loses is one wacky teen and one handful of pages of wacky teen fan fiction
ouch
 interesting
you know life's funny utahraptor i woke up this morning convinced that it would be better to die in a skydiving accident at 16 than at 50 now i don't know what to believe
actually i guess not
most detective stories reveal clues to the reader as they progress through the book allowing them to unravel the mystery with the characters and if they're good figure out the mystery before the detective does
not my detective story you guys
my detective doesn't show all the clues to the reader he's always detecting stuff that the reader doesn't know and can't know and at the end when he figures out the mastery he arrests the murderer for reasons that we aren't privy to and that no careful reading of the text will ever reveal
the end
it's not i added in some narrative tension too
as the story progresses the narrator increasingly gives up on mystery ever being solved and instead of describing the actions of the detective indulges his interest in interior decoration and describes the curtains on the wall
it is
i call my tale the stabby murderer who got detected or wow will you look at these curtains
man they say to write what you know but i think they're just jealous of my awesome imagination

man they say to write what you know but i think they're just jealous of my awesome imagination
maybe it's a good idea that people don't live forever rhetorical people i mean
like me and my dinosaur friends
if everyone lived forever then there'd still be folks alive today who feel personally aggrieved by the ancient koban culture or who hold true to their born belief that the earth rightfully belongs to i dunno the visigoths we'd never get anything done because we'd all be bickering over ancient wrongs real or imagined if we can't forgive death at least gives us the option to forget
apparently
obviously i'd rather have an alive grandparent than a dead one but i can see the advantage at the societal level in not having folks with mores thousands of years out of date still rinning around
exactly and now they're all dead and the kobans are dead and we can all go through life without dealing with their irrelevant racism
progress progress through everybody dying anf their kids eventually not caring who their parents hated
how come there wasn't science fiction a thousand years ago i gotta say
the serfs certainly dropped the ball on that one
it's weird isn't it dromiceiomimus i don't see any reason why past dudes couldn't have written stories about what life would be like down the road why couldn't they have imagined horses that when ridden fast enough travelled back through time and allowed you to sass up your parents
explain
okay that's a good point however i will not concede until at least one ancient manuscript is uncovered that includes the line hay where we're going we don't need hay and then the horseman has to flip down the visor of his armour okay
yep
pretty sure i just ate some spider eggs
there were gross red egg sac things at the bottom of my drink dromiceiomimus and i thought gross and then i said at least i didn't consume any of them though and then i forgot about how you should never say things like that because then i found some sacs stuck between my teeth too
i know
today my friend i choose pessimism
maybe these are the spiders who thrive on stomach acid maybe in a week i'll be vomiting up millions of tiny red spiders over and over again and maybe that won't be enough and the rest will eat their way out tunneling through my stomach muscles and finally skin
pessimists say that by expecting the worst they're pleasantly surprised when things don't go that badly i thought i'd give it a try but honestly
i don't think pessimists are imagining hard enough
man speaking of pessimism you know who's pessimistic
arthur friggin' schopenhauer
not only did a f s not believe that this is the best of all possible worlds he supplied a proof that this is in fact the worst of all possible worlds first he assumed that the worst possible world would be sustainable since if it ended nobody would be around to suffer prolonged suffering across millenia beats instant death
clearly
then he observed that our world is good enough to support life but just barely
sure but one small shift in orbit a slight change in temperature and it's a catastrophe on a global scale there's no wiggle room if our fragile world was only a little worse there would be no life on it at all
yep because any worse and it wouldn't be a world it would just be an empty planet without suffering and nature abhors an empty planet without suffering
anyway
i believe it was after this proof that a f s added the friggin' to his name
today is a good day i think for leitwortstil
leitwortstil is the purposeful repetition of words or phrases in a story you guys
for example a dog might always be described as that wacky jerk in a story to underline what a wacky jerk that dog turned out to be or in a collection of stories the same phrase might appear in each story which helps tie them together as a whole leitwortstil also happens when a character says the same word over and over and over again
sure
my friend i believe you are unfortunately totes wrong on this one
i stubbed my toe frig frig frig frig frig hey shakespeare i just leitwortstiled frig
 i think it's broken
i'm not afraid to admit it i've nurtured some talents and have become particularly good at certain things
for example stomping on things
i am really good at stomping on things years of practice have enabled me to put my foot above an object shift my weight to the foot with force and thus compress whatever is beneath my foot and should i see someone struggling with stomping something so hard for them and yet so easy for me i would gladly help them out
of course
and you agree that this is the right thing for me to do assuming nobody is hurt through the stomping

utahraptor we just logically proved that if raccoon poop makes me puke and you can handle it fine then you should be the one cleaning it
please utahraptor i
i can't handle the fact that my neighbours are poopy raccoons
people who say always be true to yourself fail to consider that there are completely unrepentant murderers
that's right i said it some people's true selves are total chumps
i would like it if the chumpified chicks and dudes were true to other selves please
there's lots of good ones
 batman's an obvious choice
sure
but shakespeare wrote it for a character which doesn't mean that he personally believed it you can write a story about a mad scientist and not actually want to wear retro aviator goggles all the time
i mean the rhetorical you can
 sigh
time for some new punctuation marks bitches
and double exclamation marks don't count bitches
that's right britches
i concede the point easily backstitches
yes new punctuation marks
okay so i want one that conveys all the sass of saying x bitches without the casual cussing and for any value of x i want punctuation that when read causes all readers regardless of who or when they are to whisper a frank and awed oh snap
utahraptor were you using my new punctuation there did you mean to convey convince everyone it's a good idea bitches
okay
it's just i don't really know what it sounds like yet
maslow was a dude who put all of our needs and desires into a hierarchy the whole idea was that you can't satisfy any desire at the top of the hierarchy until you satisfy those beneath it
nice going maslow
at the top is self actualization which sounds pretty great right except you can't get there unless you've already satisfied the level beneath it which is esteem and you don't get esteem both self and from others without relationships and you don't worry about friggin' relationships until your basic safety needs are met and finally you don't worry about basic safety if you need to poop
maslow said it not me
well he said the gist of it
okay no but he did come up with the theoretical framework that allows a phrase such as mine to be reasonably constructed in a meaningful context
don't look at me like that utahraptor if my life's work is only used by some guy decades down the line to crack wise about poopin' i'll count myself as one lucky dude with one awesome legacy
i set 'em up future generations knock 'em down

 sigh
dollars for sale dollars for sale
dollars for sale you guys
dollars for sale in an auction where everyone pays their highest bid whether or not they win
so when you bid 1 cent dromiceiomimus for a perfectly legitimate dollar you'll be getting a great deal and you'll make a profit of 99 cents but watch out because if utahraptor outbids you with 2 cents then you could lose your penny remember you have to pay your high bid either way
true
would you say the only winning move is not to play
you know those guys who die in really stupid preventable ways that are entirely their fault i'm pretty sure there's like a billion different timelines where i'm that guy
hah
dromiceiomimus just recently this dude was found dead with shards of glass in his heart you know what happened his new lava lamp was taking too friggin' long to warm up so he put it on his stove and heated it and it got too hot and exploded on him and he died
i know and i'm not the only one who heard that story and thought wow glad he got the lava lamp before i did
utahraptor i'm not joking
i truly believe i could've been the one who died the sort of thing he did is exactly the sort of thing you do when you're home alone and frustrated with a lava lamp you solve problems
yes but we recognize that one dies so that others may live
by we i mean of course the membership of the people who when they hear a story about an avoidable and crazy death laugh as is expected of them and then make a mental note to not do that thing anymore
our slogan is hi you are probably already a member of our awesome club
attention everyone i have some terrible news
it turns out that we never get good at splitting the bill
dromiceiomimus i ate dinner with a group of 40 year olds over the weekend and guess which table was over a third short on the bill oh hey it was our table
i know me too
but apparently adding up the cost of your items while also including tax and tip remains and unknowable dark magick even at 40 i'm dining tonight to see if it ever gets any better
thanks
utahraptor the 80 year olds paid the bill perfectly
i know and they get to be referred to by the mass noun elderlies
totally looking forward to being an old guy over here
today is the day my friends yes finally today is the day
today is the day we mess with people who have tattoos
dromiceiomimus did you hear that if you have a bird tattoo it means that you're big into hugs giving receiving watching it's all good to you
it stands for i will flip the bird right now to anyone who doesn't like hugs i'm not even joking
 yes
and a third h
the huxtables were a family on a tv show tv is what we had before we got video in our brains and everyone who read this comic when it first came out was really great even if we're all dead now
 what's the future like
huh
why not
you do
what the hell that was my idea
the idea that horses are nature's dominoes i had that idea like 5 years ago god totally stole my idea and got it as a tattoo
um according to some religions god can do anything
not mine though in my religion god now has to pay me royalties every time anyone sees his tattoo
maybe there is actually a personal benefit to being mortal and dying one day
i know it sounds crazy but stay with me
we mortal people get an end to pain that immortal dudes never get unlike immortal dudes there's a finite number of times i'm going to stub my toe so hard that it breaks one time i'll stub my toe and it'll break and i'll be able to say there that's done with i'm never stubbing my toe that friggin' hard again i can finally put this totally ridiculous aspect of being alive behind me even if i could never know it at the time
exactly
so now when something bad happens i'll assume i'll die soon so it's the last time it'll ever happen to me i'll be able to sigh and just let it go
exactly i'm not stubbing these toes any more
frig i stubbed my toes again
what
is
the
deal
with
stubbed toes that hurt really bad
i am a man who doesn't know a lot of basic things about himself i barely know what colour my eyes are
o orange deep saffron gamboge
but there's tons of other stuff i've never bothered to memorize too what's my blood type social insurance number hat size the thing is dromiceiomimus responding yes please on a questionnaire only works for some of these questions
you know what she's right i should memorize these things
well i'm going to be an adult utahraptor i'm going to memorize all sorts of useful facts about my body
whatever dudes
i decided i wanted life to have some mystery
i'm pretty sure i could be an amazing dentist you guys
in fact i'm pretty sure i'm already an amazing dentist you guys
i've got good teeth and it occurs to me that i'm the one who brushes my teeth every day and night i'm totally responsible for all the day to day oral hygiene that goes on in my awesome mouth
my dentist is more of a supervisor you know i check in with him once a year and he gives me some pointers then i pay him for the pointers
ohhhhhhhhhh
mylings are scandinavian ghosts they're way better than regular ghosts you guys
they're the ghosts of cheezed off kids
they're cheezed off ghost kids who just want to be buried properly and if you encounter one it hops on your back and demands to be taken to the nearest graveyard and as you approach the graveyard they grow heavier and heavier until they're so heavy that you can sink into the ground under their weight and if that happens then they kill you in a rage and try again with the next guy
awesome
man who knows
but what is awesome is the idea of a ghost who just wants to be buried but who despite this one consuming desire also can't resist pulling the old increasing mass piggyback ride prank
oh man i totally do
if i could increase my mass you can bet i'd be going for gag piggyback rides all the time as it stands though all i can do is eat fruit from passing trees during the ride
yeah it definitely takes too long
i'm totally going to fake my own death today
everyone don't tell anyone
i've got it all set up my diary today says i think someone's gonna murder me today and i've made youtube comments that say pretty sure someone wants to murder me > | and there won't be a body in my house just a note that says man i guess i got murdered huh
the only thing suspicious is how apparently perfect my murder is
i okay
man what if i just paid my late fees instead
david hilbert was a mathematician and hotelier who was born in 1892 he built an infinite hotel you guys
so hilbert built this infinite hotel that was infinitely big and had infinitely many rooms i believe this was a matter of some investment but build it he did and soon after a bus with infinity people in it showed up with each of them wanting a room lucky for hilbert he had his infinite hotel so each guest got a room and the hotel was filled up to capacity nice but just then another friggin' bus showed up and it also had infinity people in it
turns out they do
he just told every guest already there to move into the room that was double their current room number so the guest in room 3 moved into room 6 and so on thus only the even numbered rooms were occupied and everyone on the new bus could have an odd numbered room
yep anyway
it's my understanding that he died an infinitely rich man infinity years later
 history if full of chumps you guys
 today's historical chump is william h mumler born 1832 who was a photographer guy who did portraits only he wasn't very good photographer guy because one time he accidentally double exposed some film and the resulting image showed the one portrait clearly but also showed a ghostly image of the other portrait
 nope
 instead he embarked on a career as a spirit photographer and made a lot of money duping a lot of people including abraham lincoln's widow only peopleeventually started to notice that his ghosts looked an awful lot like living people around town
 they also eventually noticed how he was breaking into their houses so he could look at photographs and figure out what his ghosts were supposed to look like anyway like everyone else from history he eventually died and now his entire life has been compressed to a short story the end
yes today is the day for some tips on how to convince yourself that no matter what you'll never find anyone bett
okay today is the day for some tips on being romantic
flowers are nice for all sexes and genders they're pretty and also smell pretty also it can be romantic to tell someone you love them also um
okay so here's the thing probably there is someone out there who's better suited with you the odds of you both having found the one person who's absolutely best for you no matter what system you use to rank bestness are pretty small
but
but
let's say you're happy with person a 95% perfect and you meet person b who is 99% perfect it doesn't make sense to leave person a for b if you've been with them for years you lose out on all your shared history and that's like a times two multiplier
romance with a times two multiplier
 righty o
some folks got opinions you guys
some folks got opinions on what their genitals should be called you guys
by way of an example vagina comes from latin where it means sheath as in something that goes around a sword and some people are like check it my vagina does tons more than the passive sheath implies so let's call it something else
that's what some people are like dromiceiomimus
yep
but they can also be entirely free from any quasi insulting latinate etymology the other words have there's people trying to reclaim these currently taboo words in the same way queer was
yes of course sigh
it is extremely erotic
what's that computer updates are available to be installed
frig yes
i love friggin' updates why doesn't my computer do everything perfectly right now because if it did i wouldn't get the joy of friggin' updating all the time
frig that'd be awesome i love fixing stuff i didn't even break
i sure friggin' did
we'll be saying this when we're 50 years old you know we'll still be installing friggin' updates
oh frig i think the future just got awesome
for a second there i was worried the future wouldn't have the word frig written all over it
say a friggin' word enough and it loses all friggin' meaning
 frig is a bad example though because that word is great but we've all spent an afternoon saying something like waterpark over and over until there's nothing there just sounds just the empty shell of a word waterpark the oral equivalent of a forgotten childhood toy found in adulthood now strange and alien and no longer coloured by desire by anything waterpark did the word ever really have any meaning
waterpark utahraptor
it's too late to ask how or why we're done for utahraptor this is where our waterpark story ends
utahraptor i overdosed on semantic satiation the word waterpark has been sandblasted right out of my mind
that was the last instance i had
 what word
the words for mother and father are really similar if not identical across tons of languages and the reason isn't because the languages are closely related it's due to a way more awesome reason
it's because parents totally assume their babies are talking about them
it's so amazing ma pa are some of the first and easiest language like sounds babbling babies make and what's the word for mother in english mama and it's also mama in dutch and in romanian and in catalan slovak quechu romanian chinese german russian and more the languages have evolved such that the first language noise a baby makes sounds like it's saying hey mom what's up
neat
man it's great across language time and entire civilizations we're united by pointing at our babbling babies and saying yes this child is definitely talking about me
hooray for egoism
our bodies are amazing things
check it everyone
we use our mouths to talk we invent remember and teach entire languages with which to do the talking and if that fails we can talk with our hands we build planes and boats and cars and spaceships all by either using our bodies directly or by using instruments invented by our bodies we compose beautiful music and tell amazing stories all with our bodies these fleshy bags with spooky skeletons inside
and yet
and yet if we have a severe enough peanut allergy we can be killed in seconds by a single friggin' legume and hey 70% of our planet's surface is water but what happens if we spend too much time in it we drown
game over man
i used to make fun of green lantern for being vulnerable to the colour yellow then i choked on my orange juice one morning and nearly suffocated

 sigh
last night i dreamt i was preparing to buy a boat and by preparing to i mean stressing out about the confusing but necessary paperwork in order to
major snorefest
and i am not one to say major snorefest lightly dromiceiomimus
exactly but it helped me realize even when i'm dreaming of interesting things like zombies or sexin' it's still kinda disappointing
folks have already imagined those things
i want to dream about things i can't otherwise experience new colours and impossible shapes and sounds my ears could never process in dreams my brain is decoupled from my limited senses why doesn't it get on this
fine
today is the day i cook a meal for all my friends you're coming right god
 okay great
dromiceiomimus you're coming too right
a themed dish for every guest yours is on the theme vegetarian ornithomimidae
 gay
it'll be delicious here's some gay i'll say eat up
well do you like it

utahraptor your theme was really tough
with new graphics
at the very least
maybe we could tweak it a bit though advance it for the times
aw man things were going so well with the devil for once
i suggested changing the gameplay mechanics while remaking an old game
i know i know i shouldn't answer that question there exists no answer that can give any satisfaction
he's right there just talk to him
when someone accidentally gets sent to the past they always make sure to write a letter held in trust and delivered to their friends decades later telling them that they made it alright
pretty disappointed this hasn't happened to me yet you guys
maybe this letter will still be delivered to me in the future but i'll be older then if i'm to do anything about it if i'm to go back and save my friend i should be getting the letter now when i'm in my prime
huh i hadn't thought of that
 gasp
no friend of mine would commit a cuss like that to writing
nothing bad happened
i don't understand
i have led my life believing that people who write down cuss words have bad things happen to them
and it has worked out really well so far
when i saw someone writing a cuss i would think it's okay that person will have troubles down the line because of that and then they'll realize why and then they'll know not to write down cusses anymore they will have learnt their lesson but i wrote down some cusses last night and nothing bad happened
nothing
that's what i thought
but after smaller cusses didn't take i worked up to the bigger ones and even they weren't doing anything by the time it was time for bed i was writing out things like professor cuntburglar in my notebook complete with doodled 3d effects
i know but then i realized there's probably a delay so when a bunch of birds poop on my head later on this week i'm not going to wonder why
look for me i'll be the guy shielding my head with one hand while shouting don't worry everyone i deserve this
which guy just totally shredded his phone bill oh snap looks like it was this guy
i'm a dude with a shredder now ladies
i paid my phone bill and then i shredded it and then i shredded the envelope it came in and then i wrote some secrets down and shredded them i will never get tired of shredding things with my new shredder dromiceiomimus i do hereby solemnly vow and affirm that i will be big into shredders until the day i die i swear it
this is big
not anymore utahraptor i vow is the new i swear to god
oh my god this radio station sucks so bad
holy crap
i vow
that there can be none suckier
oh daaaaaaaang
why was i not informed until now
vampires can have kids dromiceiomimus they can reproduce through sex
yeah vampires can make more vampires either through bites or through sex they have an entire reproduction option that we don't have
kinda jealous over here
yep there is that
and i actually don't think the bite option is that fun anyway biting someone and getting their blood into your mouth honestly i can think of like four better ways to spend a friday night
playing video games eating food hanging out with friends and having actual sex
not necessarily all at the same time either
oh crap everybody died
i'm the last one left on the planet
oh craaaaaaaaaaa
you know what's dumb my mp3 player
it should have one of those accelerometers or whatever in it so it can charge itself from my motions throughout the day
okay that's dumb too
we should have something that can turn the motion of my legs into enough electricity to keep an mp3 player charged there i just invented it someone implement it now okay
oh my god just do it okay
my autobiography by me t rex ahem
i was born in the past
but then i got older you guys
and i made some great friends and did some cool things eventually one of these things i did was to write a book about them and that brings us up to the present
so now i'm writing my book and stepping on this tiny woman i'm kinda hungry
my friend utahraptor is sassing this book i'm writing he's really insulting all of us

 he said

i'm not really sure how i did that
i'm really not sure how that happened
for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
that's newton's third law o' motion
and it means that when i slam into a wall and bounce off and hurt myself i'm not sore because the wall is solid i'm sore because the wall hits me literally hits me the wall decides to hit me back with exactly as much force as i hit it with and i'm the one who gets hurt
man how do we know
we call it newton's law because all matter in the universe follows it but maybe every atom of matter in the universe is imbued with just enough consciousness to decide to be a retaliatory dick every chance it gets
utahraptor i can live in a world of immutable scientific laws or i can live in a world where i need to revenge myself on my kitchen floor because it smashed up a glass i dropped
wait when i put it that way it sounds kinda dumb
anything can be inspired by a true story one day i pooped to the moon
inspired by a true story
there are awards for everything awarded by everyone and if you don't specify i'm going to assume you won the worse than hitler award for real terribleness unless it's the nobel or the pulitzer i'm really not interested
yes see yes
that's the sort of dinner experience that gets people's attention that is the sort of dinner experience you put on your resume
this chowder is good but now i'm uncomfortably remembering how they only give out pulitzers for books and stuff no chowders
of course
so hey it turns out you can nominate yourself for a pulitzer prize
and it only costs fifty bucks
this is amazing dromiceiomimus anything i write can be entered for a pulitzer prize
i'm not trying to win it dromiceiomimus i'm just trying to drop so hey my diary is in the running for a pulitzer prize into conversation
maybe i'll get nominated fora nobel prize soon too
no problem we're tight with some scientists right heck we're tight with professor science if anyone can nominate us for a nobel prize it's him
 nomination for best wicked sweet friendship between two dudes my friend
 also science
teens do you love biking sure you do
you're a teen
but did you know that biking without a helmet can be dangerous actually biking with a helmet can be dangerous too biking regardless of helmet status can be dangerous
getting out of bed can be dangerous teens
but there might be teens about here
you know teens walking by on their way to somewhere else
yes eavesdropping teens who'll overhear our conversation and say holy smokes i'd better learn to love safety and then they go and learn to love safety
do they do it in the comfort of their own home do they do it in the skate park who knows they're teens
it is something i am experimenting with
let's say you can live in any time period in history which period do you choose
i choose the future
or at least i did choose the future until i realized that things might not actually be better down the road if i lived 300 years from now i could be living in a post apocalyptic time where most life has been obliterated by a catastrophic asteroid impact an impact so large that enough dirt has been thrown into the sky to block out the sun disrupting the entire food chain and causing mass extin
anyway that's a possibility or whatever
exactly
but then i thought well there's a lot we don't know about the past either and i wouldn't want to choose a time where it turns out nobody could make poop jokes or they'd go to jail and also nobody thought to write any of this down so the whole deal is lost to history
no that leaves us with changing the question so we can live in any time period real or imagined i choose the time when everyone's awesome knights
 in space
 enclosed in starships so we don't die
i used to be against people who left their christmas lights up on their houses all year long it was lazy i said
like this
that's lazy
but then i realized one of the things i most look forward to about december is going on walks at night and seeing everything lit up and it would be rad if we did that all the time
sure but i don't like them because they're special i like them because they're awesome
okay some folks are tacky
but some are totally rad you know when the edge of a house is lined with lights so from a distance it looks like a solid wireframe model
 i like those ones
i'm so tired of all my actions having consequences
oh my god is there seriously no room on this planet for a dude who loves actions but hates their consequences
gah what what for
man screw those guys if these raccoons and cephalopods want to unsettle me they should know that you really don't want to know line was never scary it's not going to work they need more than a cliche phrase to scare me dromiceiomimus
exactly
impossible
look i know you want to take their side utahraptor but there's no way those guys were what baking me a cake and suddenly ran short of flour they're planning something
it's not gonna happen
huh um thanks
gah what what for
man screw those guys if these raccoons and cephalopods want to unsettle me they should know that you really don't want to know line was never scary it's not going to work they need more than a cliche phrase to scare me dromiceiomimus
exactly
impossible
look i know you want to take their side utahraptor but there's no way those guys were what baking me a cake and suddenly ran short of flour they're planning something
it's not gonna happen
huh um thanks
oh frig you guys
we don't have a duress phrase
if i'm being forced to do something against my will i need some way to covertly communicate that to you dromiceiomimus right now all i can say is there is a dude here making me do stuff and i do not count him among my friends but they'd probably pick up on that
um enemies
maybe
but having a phrase ready for such a situation would be so awesome useful and badass that we should have one anyway something unlikely to arouse suspicion even in someone who knows us

folks say things like apples are a delicious gift from mother nature or talk about how we can use things in the way mother nature intended
that's weird you guys
we have this mother nature metaphor that we all share but rarely consider critically and it has all these connotations that are sublimated into our lives and thinking it suggests the planet tries to care for us as a mother would sure but it also suggests that plants and animals are provided by this mother with the intent of our nourishment and that nature can carry parental authority
i say we adopt some new metaphors cats and kittens
no that's the worst name i've ever heard
i was thinking more like brother entropy or uncle everybodydies you know apples are a delicious gift from aunt thestrongwilleattheweak
 climate change hurts cousin theplanetwontnoticeifwealldietomorrow
you know what'd be great a restaurant that serves gourmet versions of classic comfort foods like burgers and fish and chips
aw man really
oh you mean it's been done in alternate timelines or in the distant past because as god you have access to all possibilities ever
 huh
it's okay though
i wasn't saying the idea to be original i was saying the idea because it's a restaurant i'd like to patronize and now that it exists i intend to patronize it
you know what'd be great chef
weird i was thinking a restaurant where you don't have to pay if you're super handsome
morris the tiny bug it's been a while how are you
stress
aww morris that's nothing you have to worry about now
morris i guess sometimes your problems really are difficult
plato was a philosopher guy who said perfect dudes don't exist rather all dudes are the imperfect instantiations of the perfect ideal of dudes the essential dude intangible essence of dudeness
plato also said things like i'm hungry guys frig but we're not remembering him for that right now
ours is an imperfect world and as such there's no perfect dudes in it all the dudes we have are imperfect instances copies if you will of the ideal dude who is so great he can't even exist
okay no not technically
he was actually talking about everything but that includes dudes i used dudes because it's an example everyone can get behind
um computers can
and atoms are nature's pixels you just proved my case for me awesome
okay now bring it back to dudes
when a man and a woman love each other very much they share a very special hug
it's not always that special though you guys
sometime in the past male bedbugs realized that since they have an open circulatory system if a female doesn't want to have sex with them they can just crack open her body and inject their sperm right into her chest where it will eventually reach her ovaries and now all males have these hypodermic stab weiners and the women are left with fully functional genital tracts that are only used when it's time to deposit the eggs
yep in the form of extra genitals
they've got this paragenitalia paragenitalia on their chests that's this target for the guys but which also limits their damage and lowers the chance of infection
yeah when people talk to me about intelligent design i yell bed bugs have institutionalized stab rapes
that that normally ends the conversation right there
today i made peace with the possibility that i might never get wrapped up in a madcap case of mistaken identity
i also made peace with the possibility that i might never have kids
then i made peace with the possibility that even if i had kids they could grow up to be superduds then i went on to make peace with the possibility that there might be somewhere out there who doesn't like batman and literally nothing can change their mind
totally what i just said
yes
ouch utahraptor i promise i'll say it even if you die with tons of fully realized potential
today i made peace with the possibility that my cause of death might not be listed as kung fu
frig wait no i didn't
what day is it it's december now isn't it
it's definitely time for me to fix the great works of fiction
the great out of copyright works of fiction anyway my brilliant idea is to completely recontextualize them through the magic of framing stories so for example instead of moby dick being about this guy after a whale it's this crazy scientist writing whaler fan fiction and at the end the scientist stops and says sheesh i didn't mean to write so much whaler fan fiction
exactly
and pride and prejudice is still this fancy romance story but now it's framed by this dude being asked to describe the ultimate video game and at the end the dude says anyway after that it becomes a turned based strategy game with a focus on resource management
hamlet ends as it normally does but then the framing play starts up again and it's hamlet's dad looking into a crystal ball and he says forsooth now let's see what would happen if i won the lottery
it's so good utahraptor
hey hey you have something stuck between your teeth
and the sender of this card clearly thought the best way to tell you was to go home boot up their computer and email you a web card
hah even when the emails contain web cards
r really
okay wow that's cool i didn't know phones could do that
anyway it's like broccoli or something between your teeth maybe pesto anyway it's all over the place
it's
it's like your gums were replaced with green peanut butter
today's letter from professor science comes from alexis who writes
 dear professor how much would it cost to buy the whole dang planet
wow i guess we need to know how much our planet is worth then i'm guessing a kabazillion dollars
that works right because money itself isn't worth anything but we all pretend it's worth the value of the goods it's traded for right
true
i always knew this day would come utahraptor i i just never thought it'd be soon
alright life itself is what like twenty bucks
professor science we can scientifically prove that people are wrong for getting mad at me for saying life is worth like twenty bucks it grows in crusty milk it is like the most free thing ever professor are you even home
you know what we totally can put an exact price on life down to the nearest cent
in fact we do it all the time
every time we land somewhere on the gradient between safety and expense we do it if a new ambulance costs $100 000 but would likely save at least 100 lives while it was in use and we decide not to buy it then we're saying those particular lives aren't worth $1000 ouch sorry ambulance dudes
sure it's not a perfect measurement
all i'm saying is we estimate it all the time heck you do it whenever you're paid hourly and you speed into work divide the extra money you get by being there sooner by the increase chance of death the added speed brings you and you've just valued your own life
on the flip side whenever housecleaners clean a bathroom they're paid to kill the bacteria there so those tiny lives are worth negative dollars and there's so many bacteria utahraptor
there are like a decazillion of them i am almost certain
so um i spent a few days putting a price on life itself and now i've got a dollar figure for my own life
kinda depressing you guys
that just makes it more depressing i don't want to be commodified dromiceiomimus when people said you can't put a price on life they didn't mean it was an impossibility they meant it in the permissive sense they were trying to give me good advice
huh
 weird
the greatest proof that time travel isn't possible is that we're not being visited by tourists from the future i call this sexy t rex's argument against time travel
 fine fine
stephen hawking is a smart guy it makes sense he'd get there first however did he ever say maybe time tourists are already walking among us but they've disguised themselves so well that we've never noticed

 he would
sure but that's fine
i'm perfectly content if nobody ever talks about t rex's argument against time travel it's the idea that's important not who gets credit for it
thank you i am an extremely mature gentleman and i'm flattered you noticed
it's as forceful as i could get i love those guys
a bunch of us want to find meaning and purpose in our lives and the universe unfortunately the universe itself is indifferent uncaring and meaningless
so since the universe is totally meaningless looking for any sort of meaning in life is absurd and we're all sorta stuck but lucky for us the absurdist philosophers came up with three ways to resolve this the the first resolution is suicide
i've said it before but i'll say it again the absurdists were not the cheeriest potatoes in the bag
right
religion can give hope of a kind and caring world beyond our absurd one but since they see reason as the greatest tool we've got and religion relies on faith it's rejected by the absurdists as a just as deadly philosophical suicide
what's left only to accept the absurd and try to find any meaning we can in our own personal journey from life to death
anyway this is how come i'm so into vegetables that look like celebs
okay so turns out i might be dead someday
we all might be dead someday
and it would be great for future generations to not have to make the same mistakes i did so pay attention future generations here's what i've learnt if you know a bit about a bunch of things you'll feel confident in more situations it's nice to be nice people sometimes get pissed if you beat them in video games but whatever and getting old isn't too bad but i haven't gotten that old yet so i don't know for sure
utahraptor
i thought you were taking notes where's your notepad
um i can't because i'm busy pouring my life knowledge into the empty vessels of future generations come on we need to get on thi
if honeybabe made a mistake i might say honeybabe you made a mistake
or maybe i'd say honeybabe you blew it
maybe i'd suggest our honeybabe in question blundered did she just slip up or did she totally botch it maybe it was just an error a miscalculation an oversight a failure the words we choose indicate how severe a mistake it was but also suggest various degrees of culpability and most of us are pretty finely tuned to their nuances of meaning even honeybabes
it's got real applications
we're getting closer to computers that can choose their own words and this shows how sensitive these choices can be
yep and i'm glad you said mot juste and didn't just write it down as text as i'd have read it as mott just ee
indeed no one can be expected to keep up with that sort of tromperie
some are dead most are still around some are happy others are not so happy but i'm sure they hope to be happy soon
best of luck unhappy 80s celebrities
nobody tell them html doesn't work like that okay
niiiice
 also every bit of current day poop came from there too pretty gross
all passed away leaving behind only things others thought were worth preserving if any and memories of themselves in the minds of their equally mortal friends
this is depressing let's talk about poo atoms again
aw dang
frig dromiceiomimus i locked myself out my keys and everything else i own is trapped in a housethat thanks to my thoughlessness i no longer have access to
how can i prove i'm me all my id is inside the house
ridicilous
that is a huge loophole that any number of evil twins could exploit
ahhhhhh
hhhhhhhhparently you have been substituted for him
is how i would summarize your sentence
you guys i just wrote the best will it's the best will
it does
and that's just where it starts after my would be heirs spend the night in the haunted house which is clearly specified in my will to be actually haunted they have to successfully navigate a series of dares and challenges punching bears eating chairs that sort of thing all designed to bring them together and underline a valuable life lesson money isn't everything then they get the money
what's that
the hell this is my last chance to make people to do things for money and you're saying they're not legally bound to do it
man
dying does suck
cats and kittens chicks and dudes i was wrong
you can force your heirs to punch a bear in your will
if i make a conditional bequest while of sound mind and body and possessing full testamentary capacity a probate court is entirely likely to honour those clauses
yeah like you must punch out a bear within three weeks of my death or the diamonds go to some charity instead
only i don't actually write some charity
exactly
utahraptor i'm so excited i kinda want to become super rich now because the more money i have the more awesome clauses i can put into my will sure you can have some money now that i'm dead if you kiss fifty dudes in the next three minutes go go go
man i take it back dying is awesome
um parts of it i mean
the parts where the dead bribe the living seem pretty rad is all i'm saying
surveys are kinda baloney you guys they're kinda phoney baloney to the ultimate max
and i'm not one to say things like that often
say there's a survey about applesauce like most dudes i don't really have applesauce opinions so i'm probably not going to answer a whole survey about it but if i were big into applesauce or big against applesauce i'd be way more into answering the survey the result is that surveys overrepresent extreme viewpoints because the only people completing surveys are those interested in doing so
precisely my friend
surveys get people with opinions and the bored and the lonely but not the apathetic and the jerkasses you know what jerkasses do when some stranger calls up and asks them questions
utahraptor
 sometimes they curse first
yep
that's why they're jerkasses
time for me to invent a new emotion this is the feeling you get when you've said the wrong thing to someone by accident and it's awkward and you've both noticed it but it's days later now and you're still thinking about it
and there's nothing you can do without making things more awkward
i propose we call this emotion hugga bubba love
woo
what how so
it's not romantic love utahraptor it's hugga bubba love which i just defined as lingering awkwardness that has nothing to do with love at all
and before you say adjective phrases can't fully replace noun semantics let me warn you this one can
hugga bubba never
okay so maybe hugga bubba isn't the best adjective
maybe it is though
but just in case it isn't i've invented a new way for it to be used just like that baby now hugga bubba is also the new um the new ah and the new er instead of saying um i have no idea we can say hugga bubba i have no idea
exactly
oh man i can't wait to hear how awesome every conversation ever will be now
man it sells itself i hugga bubba don't understand why you're fighting this
oh my gosh that's the best name ever well looks my afternoon just got filled up
assuming they've removed the 5 day waiting period on me changing my name that is
a false document is when you refer to or quote books and stuff that don't exist in real life but your whole story pretends like they actually do like when shakespeare reads the dictionary
hah shakespeare's already quite the character believe you me
 he's sullen to me sometimes
oh man really
so i was totally partially right that's excellent
shakespeare if you spell assume differently you'll stop future generations from making that stupid ass out of u and me joke
it's possible that one day an advanced civilization and not necessarily our own might be able to reasonably simulate an entire universe or at least fake it for simulated people living inside
and these simulated dudes wouldn't even know they're in a simulation
and if a civilization can do this once it's likely that they'd eventually do it more than once they could even reach a point where simulations are mass produced billions of disposable toy realities used for experiments research or given to children during future christmas
sure
but if we assume that someone can reach this level then what's more likely that we're the ones who develop this technology without actually being in a simulation ourselves or that we're all stuck in one of the trillions of simulations being run as we speak
in the garden of eden story adam and eve eat an apple from the tree of knowledge and then they're kicked out of paradise and the amazing adventure of not living in a garden begins
not in my version peeps
in my version this isn't an allegory or anything instead it's an alternate history where adam and eve decide not to eat the apple the entire book of genesis grinds to a halt at the point where eve says dudes turns out i'm not hungry
then they cordon off the tree of knowledge to prevent any future mistakes finally burying it in cement chernobyl style
they invented it
they've got nothing else to do there all day so they invented cement
yes it is an amazing tale
i call it what if early abrahamic religions had not been concerned with the origin of sin but instead contained a viable recipe for cement
what if utahraptor
if i can't be a bog person i can be the next best thing
better
a person frozen solid at the north pole
or the south pole i'm not picky but i want to be perfectly preserved in some cavern somewhere so that when future generations stumble upon me they'll say oh gross there's a dead guy in here
 it looks like he died being awesome though
exactly
maybe i'll be wearing a superman outfit and in my pocket will be a note that says i actually was superman comics were documentaries about me make sure to tell everyone okay
 yeah i just found that out
people who pay for cryonic freezing are super chumps all you need to do is go to antarctica guys
you can die there for free
the earth's orbiting around the sun but our sun is orbiting around the center of the friggin' galaxy
at a speed of over eight hundred thousand kilometers an hour no less
but the galaxy is so big that each orbit takes 250 million years so every second that passes we're orbiting to a new part of space hundreds of kilometers away where no other living thing on the planet has ever been
 true
yes
so at best we've only done a little over half an orbit so we are exploring the universes we're going where no dinosaur has gone before
because utahraptor it means that today is the first time in history in all of existence that a dinosaur me did anything from the exact location in the universe that we're at right now
medals for everyone
